What is the difference between advocacy and lobbying? (when it comes to fiscal sponsorship),Email to JP,"501(c)(3) organizations can engage in some lobbying, but it cannot be a ""substantial part"" of activities. This is generally interpreted as roughly 5% of time and resources, though the IRS uses a vague ""facts and circumstances"" test. Both direct lobbying (contacting legislators) and grassroots lobbying (urging the public to contact legislators) count toward these limits. 
The IRS is intentionally very vague about this stuff. I would need to know a little more about the types of activities you plan to do before I could say if they fit within appropriate limits.

"Does anyone know how an OpenPhil Career transition grant is treated with respect to taxation in the UK, or know somewhere I could find out this information?",EA Ops Slack,"You may need to talk to a tax consultant. It depends on whether it was structured as a research grant (which would be taxable income to put on a self-assessment) or as something like training (possibly non-taxable, though not by default).
My understanding (again, talk to a tax professional) is that training/education support is possibly non-taxable, and that payment for services/professional work (i.e., you are a researcher being paid to do research or there is an expected deliverable) is likely taxable.
Insert all kinds of disclaimers about not being a tax consultant, and you should talk to a tax consultant here.",,Would need resources to answer well,"2 - Bot might be able to help, but expect struggles or mistakes",Anyone,,0

"Seeking advice re: moving file-share system to Shared Drives in Google Workspace
Hi everyone, I know there've been threads on adjacent topics before, but they seemed to have a somewhat broader scope to our situation. Currently, most of our files are in a Shared Folder owned by a central account in our Google Workspace. Many of the subfolders and files within are owned by different users. We'd like to move these to Shared Drives.
I don't want to change anything aside from move all the high-level subfolders within the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. Some of the high-level subfolders would go into an org-wide Shared Drive, while others would go into team-specific Shared Drives. My intent is to simply give all our managers the necessary permissions and ask them to move subfolders from their corner of the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. What should I be looking out for here? Any tips or best practice notes from others who have done the same thing?
Key pitfalls I'm already aware of are:
Specific subfolder permissions won't carry over. All members of the Shared Drive will be able to see everything within it unless a content manager of the Shared Drive goes and specifically changes permissions. We'll need to look out for these where sensitive subfolders are concerned. 
Forms with file upload questions will need to stay in My Drive as Shared Drives can't house these for some reason.

"Travel policies for work trips — hey, all!
we are reviewing our current travel policy and we're curious to see how you all work out your per diem rates for accommodation and food.
for context, at present our policy is:
for trips within the US: the US General Services Administration per diems rates
for trips outside of the US: 70% of the US Department of State's per diem rates
However, our current policy produces the occasional odd result (e.g. $121 per day for food in Paris and $92 in New York, when the latter is more expensive than the former).
question for all: how do you guys set your per diem rates for work trips?",EA Ops Slack,,,Should be able to answer with current resources,5 - Bot should easily answer,Anyone,,0
