    "Seeking advice re: moving file-share system to Shared Drives in Google Workspace\nHi everyone, I know there've been threads on adjacent topics before, but they seemed to have a somewhat broader scope to our situation. Currently, most of our files are in a Shared Folder owned by a central account in our Google Workspace. Many of the subfolders and files within are owned by different users. We'd like to move these to Shared Drives.\nI don't want to change anything aside from move all the high-level subfolders within the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. Some of the high-level subfolders would go into an org-wide Shared Drive, while others would go into team-specific Shared Drives. My intent is to simply give all our managers the necessary permissions and ask them to move subfolders from their corner of the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. What should I be looking out for here? Any tips or best practice notes from others who have done the same thing?\nKey pitfalls I'm already aware of are:\nSpecific subfolder permissions won't carry over. All members of the Shared Drive will be able to see everything within it unless a content manager of the Shared Drive goes and specifically changes permissions. We'll need to look out for these where sensitive subfolders are concerned. \nForms with file upload questions will need to stay in My Drive as Shared Drives can't house these for some reason.\nThanks so much for your help :slightly_smiling_face:",

    "Travel policies for work trips — hey, all!\nwe are reviewing our current travel policy and we're curious to see how you all work out your per diem rates for accommodation and food.\nfor context, at present our policy is:\nfor trips within the US: the US General Services Administration per diems rates\nfor trips outside of the US: 70% of the US Department of State's per diem rates\nHowever, our current policy produces the occasional odd result (e.g. $121 per day for food in Paris and $92 in New York, when the latter is more expensive than the former).\nquestion for all: how do you guys set your per diem rates for work trips?",
    "Hi all, does anyone here have experience in getting a UK Cyber Essentials (CE) Certificate, or setting up some sort of mobile device management (MDM) system on personal devices (including MacBooks)? Arcadia Impact is looking to get the CE cert, but we can’t figure out how to set up an MDM on personal MacBooks (or if it’s even possible), and an MDM on devices used for work seems necessary to comply with CE. (Our staff currently use their own devices for work.) Any advice/help on this would be great!",

    "This is Jeffrey with SparkWell. I got an email from one of the SW projects saying: \"assuming this is ok legally I would prefer to just approve by default (particularly for small amounts e.g. sub $100) and just review at the end of the month on our calls. Specifically this month Sanu is going to help me with a bunch of travel reimbursements I did over the last month (some of them up to £1k) but you will be able to see they are going to my account and I am less concerned with approving each of those over email vs the default being approval. Let me know if this all makes sense.\"\n\nCan you help me make them an approval policy that says X postion can approve things up to £500. Say people can't approve payments to themselves. Over £500 needs a Director.",
