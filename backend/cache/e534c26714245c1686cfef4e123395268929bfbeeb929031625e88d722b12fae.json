  "prompt": "User: we have been moved on to the final stage for a grant and they are doing due diligence. they have asked for our fiscal sponsor's IRS determination letter for tax exemption. Can you share this for SparkWell?\n\nAssistant: **Bottom line:** Yes, this is a standard request. You'll need to contact Anti-Entropy directly to obtain their IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter, as SparkWell participants operate under Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. This is a common requirement during grant due diligence when you're fiscally sponsored. Funders want to verify that their grants to...\n\nUser: What is Sparkwell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section?\n\nAssistant: **SparkWell projects operate under IRC Section 501(c)(3)** through Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. Since SparkWell is Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship program, all SparkWell projects are covered by Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) determination. This means: - Donations to your project are tax-deductible as charitable contributions - Your project operates as part of a charitable organization exempt...\n\nUser: how about a Completed IRS form W-9?",
  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking about an IRS Form W-9 for SparkWell, which is continuing the thread about grant due diligence documentation. This is another standard request from funders.\n\nA Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) is used by organizations to provide their Tax Identification Number (TIN/EIN) and other basic tax information to entities that may need to report payments to the IRS.\n\nKey points about W-9 for fiscally sponsored projects:\n\n1. Since SparkWell projects operate under Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) status, the W-9 should be Anti-Entropy's W-9, not a separate one for the individual project\n2. The W-9 would contain Anti-Entropy's:\n   - Legal name\n   - EIN (Employer Identification Number)\n   - Address\n   - Tax classification (exempt organization)\n3. The grant check/payment should be made out to Anti-Entropy (not to SparkWell or the individual project)\n4. Some fiscal sponsors will include a note on the W-9 or in an accompanying letter that specifies it's \"for the benefit of [Project Name]\"\n\nThe user needs to:\n- Request a W-9 from Anti-Entropy\n- Possibly ask if Anti-Entropy can note on it that it's for their specific SparkWell project\n- Make sure the funder understands that checks should be made payable to Anti-Entropy with a note about the specific project\n\nThis is completely standard for fiscal sponsorship arrangements.</thinking>**Bottom line:** You'll need to request Anti-Entropy's completed IRS Form W-9, as that's the legal entity receiving the grant funds. This is standard practice for fiscally sponsored projects.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **Contact Anti-Entropy** to request their W-9 form\n2. **Ask them to note** (if possible) that it's \"for the benefit of [Your SparkWell Project Name]\"\n3. **Inform the funder** that:\n   - Checks should be made payable to **Anti-Entropy** (not SparkWell or your project name)\n   - Include your project name in the memo line or accompanying documentation\n   - This is standard fiscal sponsorship structure\n\n**What will be on the W-9:**\n- Name: Anti-Entropy\n- Tax classification: Exempt organization\n- EIN: Anti-Entropy's Employer Identification Number\n- Address: Anti-Entropy's official address\n\n**Why this matters for the funder:**\n- They need the W-9 to issue a 1099 if required\n- They need to verify the correct EIN for their payment/accounting records\n- The payment must go to the legal tax-exempt entity (Anti-Entropy), not to individual projects\n\nThis is completely routine - fiscal sponsors regularly provide W-9s for their sponsored projects' grant applications.",
