  "prompt": "Hi all, does anyone here have experience in getting a UK Cyber Essentials (CE) Certificate, or setting up some sort of mobile device management (MDM) system on personal devices (including MacBooks)? Arcadia Impact is looking to get the CE cert, but we can’t figure out how to set up an MDM on personal MacBooks (or if it’s even possible), and an MDM on devices used for work seems necessary to comply with CE. (Our staff currently use their own devices for work.) Any advice/help on this would be great!",
  "response": "# RE: Cyber Essentials + MDM on Personal Devices\n\nThis is a common challenge! Here are some options:\n\n## The BYOD Problem\nYou're right that CE requires malware protection and device management, which typically means MDM. However, **enrolling personal devices in corporate MDM is problematic** because:\n- Staff often resist it (privacy concerns, company can wipe their device)\n- Legal/HR complications around personal data\n- Difficult to enforce when people leave\n\n## Practical Solutions\n\n**1. Company-owned devices (cleanest approach)**\n- Provide work laptops/phones to staff\n- Full MDM enrollment is straightforward\n- Clear separation of work/personal\n- Can be refurbished/budget devices\n\n**2. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**\n- Staff access work environment via browser/app\n- No data stored on personal devices\n- Can satisfy CE requirements without MDM on personal hardware\n- Services like Azure Virtual Desktop, Amazon WorkSpaces\n\n**3. BYOD-friendly MDM solutions**\n- **Jamf Now** or **Mosyle** for Macs (lighter touch)\n- **Microsoft Intune** with MAM (Mobile Application Management) instead of full MDM\n- Containerized work apps only, doesn't control whole device\n\n**4. Cyber Essentials Basic vs Plus**\n- CE Basic is self-assessed - some assessors are more flexible on BYOD\n- Consider your actual risk level vs compliance checkbox\n\n## My Recommendation\nFor a small organization, **providing basic work devices** is usually cheapest and clearest long-term. Even budget MacBook Airs (~£900) avoid ongoing BYOD headaches.\n\nWhat's your team size and budget situation?",
