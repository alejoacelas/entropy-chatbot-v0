  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking about SparkWell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section. Based on the previous context, SparkWell operates under fiscal sponsorship by Anti-Entropy, which has 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.\n\nWhen an organization operates under fiscal sponsorship, they don't have their own separate IRC designation - they operate under their fiscal sponsor's tax-exempt status.\n\nSince Anti-Entropy is mentioned as having 501(c)(3) status, SparkWell would operate under:\n- IRC Section 501(c)(3) - which is the code section for tax-exempt charitable organizations\n\nSo SparkWell itself doesn't have its own IRC section designation, but operates under Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) status.</thinking>**Bottom line:** SparkWell operates under IRC Section **501(c)(3)** through its fiscal sponsor, Anti-Entropy.\n\nSince SparkWell is fiscally sponsored by Anti-Entropy rather than being an independent nonprofit, it doesn't have its own separate IRS determination. Instead, SparkWell participants benefit from Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.\n\n**For grant applications, you should:**\n- List IRC Section: **501(c)(3)**\n- Note that this status is through fiscal sponsor Anti-Entropy\n- Provide Anti-Entropy's EIN (Employer Identification Number) when requested\n- Include Anti-Entropy's IRS determination letter as documentation\n\nThis is the standard classification for charitable, educational, religious, and similar organizations that qualify for tax-exempt status under U.S. tax law.",
