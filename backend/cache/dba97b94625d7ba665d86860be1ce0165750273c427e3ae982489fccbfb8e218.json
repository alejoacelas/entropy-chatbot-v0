  "prompt": "Travel policies for work trips — hey, all!\nwe are reviewing our current travel policy and we're curious to see how you all work out your per diem rates for accommodation and food.\nfor context, at present our policy is:\nfor trips within the US: the US General Services Administration per diems rates\nfor trips outside of the US: 70% of the US Department of State's per diem rates\nHowever, our current policy produces the occasional odd result (e.g. $121 per day for food in Paris and $92 in New York, when the latter is more expensive than the former).\nquestion for all: how do you guys set your per diem rates for work trips?",
  "response": "# A few approaches I've seen work well:\n\n## 1. **Actual expenses with reasonable caps**\n- Skip per diems entirely for meals\n- Require receipts, reimburse actual costs up to a daily maximum\n- Prevents the \"gaming\" of per diems while being fairer across locations\n- More admin work, but tools like Expensify make this easier\n\n## 2. **Tiered city system**\n- Group cities into 3-4 tiers (e.g., high-cost metros, mid-size cities, smaller markets, international)\n- Set flat rates for each tier\n- Much simpler than location-by-location rates\n- Example: Tier 1 ($100/day), Tier 2 ($75/day), Tier 3 ($50/day)\n\n## 3. **Hybrid approach**\n- Lodging: actual cost with pre-approval for reasonable hotels\n- Meals: flat per diem regardless of location (e.g., $75/day everywhere)\n- Simpler to administer, and meal costs don't vary as wildly as lodging\n\n## 4. **Keep GSA but add adjustment factor**\n- Use GSA as baseline but apply consistent multiplier for international (you're already doing this)\n- Add manual review/adjustment for obvious outliers\n- Publish an exceptions list for known problem cities\n\n## On your Paris/NYC example:\nThe State Department rates factor in different dining norms (longer meals, alcohol included in European business dining, etc.). Consider whether your *actual* employee spending patterns match these assumptions.\n\n**What's your team size?** That often determines whether detailed tracking is worth the administrative overhead.",
