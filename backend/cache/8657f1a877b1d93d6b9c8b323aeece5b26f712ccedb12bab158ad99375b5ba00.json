  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking me to share an IRS determination letter for tax exemption for an organization called \"SparkWell\" which they say is their fiscal sponsor. \n\nThis is a request for a specific legal/financial document that I cannot and should not provide because:\n\n1. I don't have access to specific organizations' private tax documents\n2. I cannot retrieve or share confidential organizational documents\n3. Such letters are official IRS documents that should only be obtained from the organization itself or through proper channels\n4. Even if I had information about SparkWell, sharing such documents would be inappropriate\n\nThe appropriate response is to:\n- Clarify that I cannot provide such documents\n- Suggest they contact SparkWell directly (their fiscal sponsor)\n- Explain that fiscal sponsors typically have these documents readily available for grantees\n- Note that this is a routine request and the fiscal sponsor should be able to provide it quickly\n\nI should be helpful in guiding them on how to properly obtain this document rather than trying to provide something I cannot access.</thinking>I don't have access to specific organizations' IRS determination letters or other confidential documents. You'll need to reach out directly to SparkWell for this.\n\n**Here's what you should do:**\n\n1. **Contact SparkWell directly** - Email or call your primary contact at SparkWell and explain that you need their 501(c)(3) determination letter for a grant due diligence process\n\n2. **This is a routine request** - Fiscal sponsors are very familiar with this ask and typically have these documents ready to share with their sponsored projects\n\n3. **What to request specifically:**\n   - IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter (also called an exemption letter)\n   - Their EIN (Employer Identification Number) if needed\n   - Sometimes called a \"tax-exempt status letter\"\n\n4. **Timeline** - Mention your deadline for the grant submission so they can prioritize your request\n\nIf SparkWell is indeed your fiscal sponsor, they should be able to provide this within 1-2 business days, as it's a standard document they keep on hand for situations exactly like this.\n\nIs SparkWell definitely your fiscal sponsor, or are you still in the process of setting up that relationship?",
