  "prompt": "should I start a charity?",
  "response": "<thinking>This is a straightforward question about whether someone should start a charity. Let me think about how to give helpful, balanced advice.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Starting a charity is a significant commitment requiring time, resources, and expertise\n- There are often more effective ways to have impact (donating to existing effective charities, volunteering, working in needed fields)\n- It depends on their specific situation, skills, resources, and what problem they want to address\n\nI should ask clarifying questions and present both sides:\n\nReasons you might:\n- You've identified a gap that existing charities don't fill\n- You have specific expertise/connections for a cause\n- You have capacity to commit significant time\n- You have funding/fundraising ability\n\nReasons you might not:\n- Existing charities may already address this effectively\n- Starting a charity has significant overhead (legal, administrative)\n- Your resources might have more impact donated to effective existing charities\n- It requires ongoing commitment\n\nI should be helpful but realistic, and ask about their situation.</thinking>It depends on your situation. Some questions to consider:\n\n**You might want to if:**\n- You've identified a genuine gap that existing charities don't address\n- You have specific expertise, connections, or resources for this cause\n- You're prepared for significant time commitment (legal setup, governance, fundraising, operations)\n- You have a realistic funding plan\n\n**You might not want to if:**\n- Effective charities already do this work (your money/time could go further by supporting them)\n- You're primarily motivated by wanting to \"do good\" generally - donating effectively or volunteering might have more impact per hour invested\n- You underestimate the administrative burden\n\n**Questions to ask yourself:**\n- What specific problem am I solving, and how?\n- Who else is working on this, and why would a new organization be better?\n- Do I have 10+ hours/week to dedicate?\n- Do I have governance/fundraising experience or partners who do?\n\nMany people overestimate how much good a new small charity can do versus donating that same money to proven effective charities. But if you've found a genuine gap and have the capacity, it could be worthwhile.\n\nWhat's motivating this idea for you?",
