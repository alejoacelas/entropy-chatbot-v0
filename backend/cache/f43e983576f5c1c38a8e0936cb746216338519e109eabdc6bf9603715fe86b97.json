  "prompt": "Would anyone be willing to share what their process is for handling the inboxes of departed employees? e.g. set up an autoforward to their manager for a set period of time, give their log in to someone else for a set period of time, use Google takeout or similar to preserve the emails, archive/delete the account straight away",
  "response": "# Common Approaches for Departed Employee Inboxes\n\nHere are the most frequently used methods:\n\n## **Auto-forward or Delegate Access** (Most Common)\n- Forward to manager or team member for 30-90 days\n- Use delegation/shared mailbox features rather than sharing passwords\n- Gradually reduces forwarding period to wean senders off the old address\n\n## **Auto-reply Setup**\n- Configure out-of-office message directing people to new contact\n- Include this even if forwarding is enabled\n- Typically run for 30-60 days\n\n## **Convert to Shared/Group Mailbox**\n- Useful if the role will be refilled\n- Multiple people can access without password sharing\n- Maintains continuity for ongoing projects\n\n## **Archive/Export Before Deletion**\n- Use Google Takeout, PST export, or native archiving\n- Store according to retention policies (legal/compliance requirements)\n- Keep for 1-7 years depending on industry regulations\n\n## **Timeline Example**\n- **Day 1:** Disable login, set auto-reply, forward to manager\n- **30 days:** Export/archive emails\n- **60-90 days:** Stop forwarding, maintain archive only\n- **Per policy:** Delete after retention period expires\n\n## **Important Considerations**\n- **Never share actual login credentials** - use proper delegation features\n- Check legal/compliance requirements for your industry\n- Document the process for consistency\n- Consider whether litigation hold applies\n\nWhat industry are you in? Retention requirements vary significantly.",
