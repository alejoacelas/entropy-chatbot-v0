  "prompt": "User: we have been moved on to the final stage for a grant and they are doing due diligence. they have asked for our fiscal sponsor's IRS determination letter for tax exemption. Can you share this for SparkWell?\n\nAssistant: **Bottom line:** Yes, this is a standard request. You'll need to contact Anti-Entropy directly to obtain their IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter, as SparkWell participants operate under Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. This is a common requirement during grant due diligence when you're fiscally sponsored. Funders want to verify that their grants to...\n\nUser: What is Sparkwell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section?\n\nAssistant: **SparkWell projects operate under IRC Section 501(c)(3)** through Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. Since SparkWell is Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship program, all SparkWell projects are covered by Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) determination. This means: - Donations to your project are tax-deductible as charitable contributions - Your project operates as part of a charitable organization exempt...\n\nUser: how about a Completed IRS form W-9?",
  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking about a completed IRS Form W-9 for their SparkWell project, which is part of the grant due diligence process.\n\nForm W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) is used to provide:\n- The organization's legal name\n- Tax Identification Number (TIN/EIN)\n- Address\n- Tax classification\n\nSince SparkWell projects operate under Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship:\n- The W-9 would be for Anti-Entropy, not SparkWell specifically\n- It would have Anti-Entropy's EIN (Employer Identification Number)\n- It would show Anti-Entropy as the legal entity\n- The address would be Anti-Entropy's address\n\nThis is another standard due diligence document that funders request to:\n- Verify the tax ID for issuing payments\n- Ensure proper tax reporting (1099s if needed)\n- Confirm the legal entity receiving funds\n\nThe user would need to:\n1. Contact Anti-Entropy to get their completed W-9\n2. Or Anti-Entropy might complete a W-9 specifically for this grant\n3. Some fiscal sponsors have a standard W-9 they provide to all sponsored projects\n\nI should explain this clearly and note that this is standard practice.</thinking>**Bottom line:** You'll need to request a completed W-9 from Anti-Entropy, as they are the legal entity that will receive the grant funds.\n\n**What this means:**\n\nSince SparkWell projects operate under Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship, the W-9 should contain:\n- **Legal Name:** Anti-Entropy Foundation (or their exact legal name)\n- **Tax ID:** Anti-Entropy's EIN (Employer Identification Number)\n- **Tax Classification:** 501(c)(3) exempt organization\n- **Address:** Anti-Entropy's official address\n\n**Why funders need this:**\n- To issue payments to the correct legal entity\n- For tax reporting purposes (though 501(c)(3)s typically don't receive 1099s)\n- To verify the EIN matches the determination letter\n- To ensure proper payment processing\n\n**Next steps:**\n1. Contact Anti-Entropy and let them know you need a W-9 for grant due diligence\n2. They may have a standard W-9 they provide to all sponsored projects\n3. Some fiscal sponsors will complete a fresh W-9 for each grant to ensure current information\n\n**Note:** The W-9 will show Anti-Entropy as the payee, which is correct. You can clarify to the funder that grant payments should be made to Anti-Entropy with a notation for your specific SparkWell project name in the memo/reference line.\n\nWould you like help drafting the email to Anti-Entropy requesting this?",
