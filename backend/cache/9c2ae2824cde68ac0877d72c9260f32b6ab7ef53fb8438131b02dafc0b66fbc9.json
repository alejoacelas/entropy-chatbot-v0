  "prompt": "This is Jeffrey with SparkWell. I got an email from one of the SW projects saying: \"assuming this is ok legally I would prefer to just approve by default (particularly for small amounts e.g. sub $100) and just review at the end of the month on our calls. Specifically this month Sanu is going to help me with a bunch of travel reimbursements I did over the last month (some of them up to £1k) but you will be able to see they are going to my account and I am less concerned with approving each of those over email vs the default being approval. Let me know if this all makes sense.\"\n\nCan you help me make them an approval policy that says X postion can approve things up to £500. Say people can't approve payments to themselves. Over £500 needs a Director.",
  "response": "Here's a draft approval policy for your SparkWell project:\n\n---\n\n**PAYMENT APPROVAL POLICY**\n\n**Approval Limits by Position:**\n\n- **[Project Lead/Manager]**: May approve payments up to £500\n- **Director**: Required for payments over £500\n\n**Self-Approval Restriction:**\n\nNo individual may approve payments to themselves, regardless of amount or position. All personal reimbursements (including travel expenses) must be approved by another authorized approver.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. Payments under £500: Require approval from Project Lead/Manager (or higher)\n2. Payments over £500: Require Director approval\n3. Personal reimbursements: Must be approved by someone other than the payee\n4. Monthly review: All approved payments will be reviewed during monthly calls\n\n**For the specific situation mentioned:**\n\nThe travel reimbursements (some up to £1k) going to the requestor's own account would need to be approved by either:\n- Another Project Lead/Manager (for amounts under £500), OR\n- A Director (for amounts over £500)\n\nThe requestor cannot approve these themselves, even if they have approval authority for other payments.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to adjust the position titles or amounts?",
