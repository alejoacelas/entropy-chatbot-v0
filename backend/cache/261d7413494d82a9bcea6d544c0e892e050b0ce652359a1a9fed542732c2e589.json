  "prompt": "User: we have been moved on to the final stage for a grant and they are doing due diligence. they have asked for our fiscal sponsor's IRS determination letter for tax exemption. Can you share this for SparkWell?\n\nAssistant: **Bottom line:** Yes, this is a standard request. You'll need to contact Anti-Entropy directly to obtain their IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter, as SparkWell participants operate under Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. This is a common requirement during grant due diligence when you're fiscally sponsored. Funders want to verify that their grants to...\n\nUser: What is Sparkwell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section?\n\nAssistant: **SparkWell projects operate under IRC Section 501(c)(3)** through Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. Since SparkWell is Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship program, all SparkWell projects are covered by Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) determination. This means: - Donations to your project are tax-deductible as charitable contributions - Your project operates as part of a charitable organization exempt...\n\nUser: how about a Completed IRS form W-9?\n\nAssistant: **You'll need to request a completed W-9 from Anti-Entropy directly**, as SparkWell projects use Anti-Entropy's tax identification information. The W-9 will show: - **Name:** Anti-Entropy (or their full legal name) - **EIN:** 88-0967420 - **Tax classification:** Typically checked as \"Other\" with \"501(c)(3) nonprofit\" or similar designation **Why funders request this:**...\n\nUser: Does Anti Entropy or Sparkwell do any business in California, such as having employees there and/or soliciting/accepting contributions from California residents?",
  "response": "<thinking>This is a question about whether Anti-Entropy (SparkWell's parent organization) has any business presence in California. This is likely being asked for state-level charitable registration requirements, as many states (including California) require nonprofits that solicit donations from their residents to register with the state.\n\nBased on what I know:\n- Anti-Entropy is the fiscal sponsor\n- SparkWell is their fiscal sponsorship program\n- I don't have specific information about Anti-Entropy's physical location, employee locations, or where they solicit donations\n\nThis is likely being asked because California has charitable solicitation registration requirements. If Anti-Entropy:\n1. Has employees in California, OR\n2. Solicits donations from California residents, OR\n3. Has other significant business activities in California\n\nThen they may need to be registered with the California Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts.\n\nSince I don't have specific information about Anti-Entropy's operations, locations, or where they solicit donations, I should:\n1. Acknowledge this is likely a state registration question\n2. Explain why it's being asked\n3. Direct them to check with Anti-Entropy directly for accurate information\n4. Mention that if they DO accept donations from California residents (which is likely if they accept online donations), they may need to be registered\n\nI should be careful not to make assumptions about Anti-Entropy's specific operations or locations without concrete information.</thinking>**You'll need to confirm this directly with Anti-Entropy**, but here's why they're asking:\n\n**Why this matters:**\nCalifornia requires nonprofits that solicit donations from California residents to register with the state's Registry of Charitable Trusts (Attorney General's office). This applies if Anti-Entropy:\n- Has employees or physical presence in California\n- Solicits or accepts contributions from California residents (including online donations)\n- Conducts charitable programs in California\n\n**Likely answer:** If Anti-Entropy accepts online donations or has SparkWell projects that accept contributions nationally, they're probably soliciting from California residents and would need to answer \"yes.\"\n\n**What to ask Anti-Entropy:**\n1. Do you have any employees or physical offices in California?\n2. Do you accept donations from California residents?\n3. Are you registered with the California Registry of Charitable Trusts?\n4. What's your California registration number (if applicable)?\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Contact Anti-Entropy to get their California registration status\n- If they're not registered but should be, they may need to register before your grant can be finalized\n- Some funders require California registration before they can grant to fiscally sponsored projects\n\nThis is a standard compliance question for funders based in California or following California regulations.",
