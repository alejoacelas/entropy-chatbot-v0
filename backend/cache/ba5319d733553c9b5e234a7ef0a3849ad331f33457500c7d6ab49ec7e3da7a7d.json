  "prompt": "Seeking advice re: moving file-share system to Shared Drives in Google Workspace\nHi everyone, I know there've been threads on adjacent topics before, but they seemed to have a somewhat broader scope to our situation. Currently, most of our files are in a Shared Folder owned by a central account in our Google Workspace. Many of the subfolders and files within are owned by different users. We'd like to move these to Shared Drives.\nI don't want to change anything aside from move all the high-level subfolders within the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. Some of the high-level subfolders would go into an org-wide Shared Drive, while others would go into team-specific Shared Drives. My intent is to simply give all our managers the necessary permissions and ask them to move subfolders from their corner of the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. What should I be looking out for here? Any tips or best practice notes from others who have done the same thing?\nKey pitfalls I'm already aware of are:\nSpecific subfolder permissions won't carry over. All members of the Shared Drive will be able to see everything within it unless a content manager of the Shared Drive goes and specifically changes permissions. We'll need to look out for these where sensitive subfolders are concerned. \nForms with file upload questions will need to stay in My Drive as Shared Drives can't house these for some reason.\nThanks so much for your help :slightly_smiling_face:",
  "response": "# Great that you're planning this migration carefully! Here are some additional considerations:\n\n## Ownership & Permission Issues\n\n**Ownership transfer complications:**\n- Files owned by users who've left the organization can cause issues. You may need to transfer ownership of these files *before* moving to Shared Drives, as you can't move files you don't own.\n- Consider using Google's Drive audit tools or third-party tools to identify orphaned files first.\n\n**External sharing:**\n- Any externally shared links will break when moved to Shared Drives. You'll need to reshare with external users after the move.\n- Document existing external shares beforehand so you can recreate them.\n\n## Technical Limitations\n\n**File/folder limits:**\n- Shared Drives have a 400,000 item limit per drive. Check your folder sizes first.\n- Individual users can only be a member of 100 Shared Drives.\n\n**Shortcuts won't move:**\n- Any shortcuts in the current structure will break and need to be recreated.\n\n**Apps Script & integrations:**\n- Any scripts, third-party integrations, or automated workflows referencing file IDs may break since the file location changes.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Pilot first:**\n- Test with one small team/folder before rolling out org-wide.\n- This helps identify issues specific to your setup.\n\n**Communication plan:**\n- Users should avoid editing files during the migration window.\n- Bookmarks and starred files will need to be updated by users.\n\n**Shared Drive structure:**\n- Set up your Shared Drive permission levels (Manager, Content Manager, Contributor, Commenter, Viewer) *before* moving content.\n- Consider having 2+ managers per Shared Drive to avoid single points of failure.\n\n**Sync issues:**\n- Users with Drive for Desktop may experience sync conflicts during the move. Consider asking them to pause sync temporarily.\n\n## Migration Approach\n\nRather than having managers do this manually, consider:\n- Using Google's **Drive API** or tools like **GAM** for bulk moves (more controlled, auditable)\n- Creating a spreadsheet tracking what's been moved and what hasn't\n- Moving in phases rather than all at once\n\n**One more thing:** Google Takeout backups won't include Shared Drive content by default, so ensure your backup strategy accounts for this change.\n\nGood luck with the migration! 🙂",
