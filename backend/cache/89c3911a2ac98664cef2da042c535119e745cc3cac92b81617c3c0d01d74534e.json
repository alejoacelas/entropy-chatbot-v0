  "response": "<thinking>This is a question about Anti-Entropy's and SparkWell's operations in California, specifically regarding employees and fundraising activities. This is likely being asked because:\n\n1. California has specific charitable solicitation registration requirements\n2. Many states require nonprofits that solicit donations from their residents to register\n3. This is likely part of the due diligence questions from the funder\n\nLet me think about what I know:\n- Anti-Entropy is the fiscal sponsor with EIN 88-0967420\n- SparkWell is their fiscal sponsorship program\n- I don't have specific information about Anti-Entropy's employee locations\n- SparkWell projects accept donations from various locations through Anti-Entropy\n\nFor California specifically:\n- California requires charitable organizations to register with the Registry of Charitable Trusts (Attorney General's office) if they solicit donations from California residents\n- \"Soliciting\" is broadly defined and can include online donation requests\n- Having employees in California could trigger various state requirements\n\nI should:\n1. Acknowledge this is a compliance/registration question\n2. Explain why it's being asked (likely California charitable registration requirements)\n3. Be clear that I don't have specific information about Anti-Entropy's operations\n4. Direct them to contact Anti-Entropy directly for accurate information\n5. Give context about why this matters (state registration requirements)\n\nI should NOT make assumptions about whether Anti-Entropy has California employees or whether they're registered in California.</thinking>**You'll need to check directly with Anti-Entropy** for accurate information about their California operations and registration status.\n\nThis question is typically asked because:\n\n**California charitable registration requirements:**\n- Organizations that solicit donations from California residents generally must register with the California Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts\n- \"Solicitation\" is broadly defined and includes online fundraising\n- Having employees or physical presence in California can trigger additional requirements\n\n**What to ask Anti-Entropy:**\n\n1. **Employees/presence:** Does Anti-Entropy have any employees, contractors, or office locations in California?\n\n2. **Fundraising registration:** Is Anti-Entropy registered with the California Registry of Charitable Trusts (Form CT-1)?\n\n3. **SparkWell projects:** Since SparkWell projects accept donations through Anti-Entropy, are they covered under Anti-Entropy's California registration (if applicable)?\n\n**Why this matters for your grant:**\nFunders want to ensure compliance with state charitable solicitation laws, especially if:\n- The grant will support activities in California\n- Your project solicits donations online (accessible to California residents)\n- The funder is based in California\n\n**Contact:** Reach out to Anti-Entropy's team to get their current California compliance status and any relevant documentation.",
