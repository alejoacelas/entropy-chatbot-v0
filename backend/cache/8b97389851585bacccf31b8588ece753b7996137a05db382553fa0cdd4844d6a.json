  "prompt": "Can I just pay him (nonemployee or contractor) from my personal account and then request reimbursement the next time I invoice, even though there won't be any official receipt as he is an individual?",
  "response": "# Yes, you can do this, but you need proper documentation\n\n## What You Need:\n\n1. **Written agreement/contract** with the contractor showing:\n   - Scope of work\n   - Payment amount agreed upon\n   - Date of service\n\n2. **Proof of payment** from your personal account:\n   - Bank statement showing the transfer\n   - Screenshot of payment confirmation\n   - Cancelled check (if applicable)\n\n3. **Receipt or invoice from the contractor**:\n   - Even individuals can provide a simple written receipt\n   - Should include: date, amount, description of services, their name/signature\n   - Can be handwritten or typed\n\n## Best Practice:\n\n**Ask the contractor to provide a simple receipt** that includes:\n- Their name and contact info\n- Date\n- Amount paid\n- Description of services provided\n- Their signature\n\nThis protects both of you and makes reimbursement much smoother.\n\n## For Your Reimbursement Request:\n\nSubmit:\n- The contractor's receipt/invoice\n- Your proof of payment\n- Brief explanation of why this expense was necessary for the project\n\n---\n\n**Important:** Check your company's expense policy - some organizations require pre-approval for contractor payments or have specific procedures for this type of reimbursement.\n\nIs this for a one-time payment or ongoing contractor relationship?",
