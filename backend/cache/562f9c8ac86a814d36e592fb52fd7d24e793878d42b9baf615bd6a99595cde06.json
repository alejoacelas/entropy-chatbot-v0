  "response": "# I can help with UK government grant compliance and UK Spend requirements!\n\nI have experience with UK public sector grant conditions. Here are some key areas I can discuss:\n\n## Common UK Spend Requirements:\n\n**Subsidy Control Act 2022** (replaced State Aid post-Brexit)\n- Compliance with subsidy control principles\n- Reporting thresholds and transparency requirements\n\n**Grant Conditions Typically Include:**\n- Procurement rules (often following Public Contracts Regulations)\n- Value for money requirements\n- Audit and record-keeping obligations\n- Clawback provisions\n- Monitoring and reporting schedules\n\n**Specific Schemes:**\n- Innovate UK grants\n- UKRI funding\n- Local authority grants\n- Levelling Up Fund\n- Shared Prosperity Fund\n\n## What specifically are you dealing with?\n\n- Which grant scheme/department?\n- What stage are you at (application, post-award, reporting)?\n- Specific compliance questions (procurement, eligible costs, reporting)?\n- Issues with spend profiles or drawdown?\n\nThe requirements can vary significantly depending on the funding body and grant type. If you share more details about your situation, I can provide more targeted guidance on navigating the requirements.\n\nAre there particular pain points you're encountering?",
