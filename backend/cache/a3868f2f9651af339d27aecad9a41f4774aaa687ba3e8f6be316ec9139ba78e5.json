  "response": "# Transferring IP from UK CLG to US 501(c)(3)\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n### UK Side (Winding Down CLG)\n\n1. **Check your Articles of Association**\n   - Most charitable CLGs have \"asset lock\" provisions requiring assets go to similar charitable purposes\n   - May require member approval for IP transfer\n\n2. **Charity Commission compliance** (if registered charity)\n   - Must demonstrate transfer serves charitable objects\n   - May need Charity Commission approval for significant asset transfers\n   - Document that US 501(c)(3) has similar charitable purposes\n\n3. **Tax implications**\n   - Generally no UK tax on asset transfers between charities\n   - Ensure proper valuation if IP has significant value\n\n### US Side (Receiving Entity)\n\n1. **IRS considerations**\n   - Transfer should align with 501(c)(3)'s exempt purposes\n   - Document as donation/contribution (not purchase)\n   - Get proper valuation if IP value >$5,000 (for donor's tax purposes, though less relevant for non-profit to non-profit)\n\n2. **State law compliance**\n   - Check state registration requirements for foreign asset transfers\n\n## Practical Steps\n\n1. **IP Assignment Agreement**\n   - Identify all IP (trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets)\n   - Draft assignment agreement stating transfer is for charitable purposes\n   - Consider \"nil consideration\" or nominal amount\n\n2. **Record the transfers:**\n   - **Trademarks**: File assignments with UK IPO and USPTO\n   - **Domain names**: Transfer through registrar\n   - **Copyrights**: Document assignment (registration optional but recommended)\n   - **Patents**: Record with relevant patent offices\n\n3. **Board resolutions** from both entities approving transfer\n\n4. **Dissolution planning** for UK CLG per Companies House requirements\n\n**Recommend consulting:** UK charity solicitor + US non-profit attorney to ensure compliance both sides.\n\nWhat type of IP are you transferring?",
