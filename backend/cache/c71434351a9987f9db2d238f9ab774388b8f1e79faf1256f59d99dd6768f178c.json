  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking about SparkWell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section. Based on the context provided, SparkWell operates under Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship, and Anti-Entropy has 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.\n\nWhen an organization is fiscally sponsored, it operates under the IRC section of its fiscal sponsor. Since Anti-Entropy is mentioned as having 501(c)(3) status, SparkWell would operate under IRC Section 501(c)(3) through Anti-Entropy.\n\nIRC Section 501(c)(3) is for organizations that are:\n- Charitable\n- Religious\n- Educational\n- Scientific\n- Literary\n- Testing for public safety\n- Fostering national or international amateur sports competition\n- Preventing cruelty to children or animals\n\nSince SparkWell is fiscally sponsored by Anti-Entropy, it doesn't have its own separate IRC determination - it operates under Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) status.</thinking>**SparkWell operates under IRC Section 501(c)(3)** through its fiscal sponsor, Anti-Entropy.\n\nSince SparkWell is fiscally sponsored rather than an independent nonprofit, it doesn't have its own separate IRS determination. Instead, it operates under Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status, which is classified as:\n\n**IRC Section 501(c)(3)** - charitable/educational organization\n\nThis means:\n- Donations to SparkWell (through Anti-Entropy) are tax-deductible\n- SparkWell is exempt from federal income tax\n- It operates as a public charity under Anti-Entropy's umbrella\n\nFor grant applications, you would list:\n- **IRC Section:** 501(c)(3)\n- **Tax-Exempt Organization:** Anti-Entropy (fiscal sponsor)\n- **EIN:** Anti-Entropy's EIN (not a separate EIN for SparkWell)\n\nThis is the standard arrangement for fiscally sponsored projects.",
