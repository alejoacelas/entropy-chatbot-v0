Is there a real gap?**\n- Does a charity already exist doing this work effectively? [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) and [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) can help you research existing organizations\n- Could you achieve more impact by supporting/volunteering with existing charities rather than starting from scratch?\n\n**2. Do you have the resources?**\n- **Time commitment**: Running a charity typically requires 20+ hours/week initially\n- **Financial resources**: Start-up costs, legal fees, ongoing operational expenses\n- **Skills needed**: Fundraising, accounting, governance, program management\n\n**3. What's your goal?**\n- If it's **making maximum impact** → Often more effective to donate to established, evidence-based charities\n- If it's **addressing a unique local need** → Starting new may make sense\n- If it's **building community** → Consider fiscal sponsorship or informal giving circles first\n\n## Alternatives Worth Considering:\n\n- **[Donor-Advised Funds](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/guidance/philanthropy/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund.html)** - Simpler than a full charity\n- **[Fiscal sponsorship](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/fiscal-sponsorship)** - Run your program under an existing nonprofit\n- **Major volunteering/board roles** with existing charities\n\n**Would you like to share more about what cause you're passionate about and what you're hoping to achieve?** That would help me provide more specific guidance!",
