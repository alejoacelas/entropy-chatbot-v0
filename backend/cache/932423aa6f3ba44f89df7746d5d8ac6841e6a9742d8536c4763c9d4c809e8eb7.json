  "prompt": "How much weekly time on average does it require handling the overhead of being a registered nonprofit? (assuming I'm fiscally sponsored). What does that depend on?",
  "response": "# Time Requirements for Fiscally Sponsored Nonprofits\n\n## Typical Weekly Time Investment\n\n**2-5 hours per week** on average for most small fiscally sponsored projects, though this varies significantly.\n\n## What It Depends On\n\n### **Size & Complexity**\n- **Budget size**: $50K/year vs $500K/year makes a huge difference\n- **Number of transactions**: More grants/donors = more tracking\n- **Staff**: Volunteers only vs paid employees (payroll adds overhead)\n\n### **Your Fiscal Sponsor's Systems**\n- **Good sponsor**: Handles most compliance, provides clear templates, has online portals (minimal time)\n- **Bare-bones sponsor**: You do more tracking and documentation yourself\n- **Their fee structure**: Higher fees (8-15%) usually mean they do more work\n\n### **Funding Sources**\n- **Individual donations**: Relatively light (acknowledgment letters, basic tracking)\n- **Foundation grants**: Moderate (reports, budget tracking, outcomes measurement)\n- **Government grants**: Heavy (extensive reporting, compliance requirements, audits)\n\n### **Your Role**\n- **Just program work**: 2-3 hours/week\n- **Also doing fundraising**: Add 3-10+ hours/week\n- **Managing volunteers/contractors**: Add 2-5 hours/week\n\n## Typical Tasks\n- Monthly financial reconciliation\n- Donor acknowledgments\n- Grant reporting\n- Communication with fiscal sponsor\n- Basic record-keeping\n\n## Pro Tip\nAsk potential fiscal sponsors: *\"What does a typical project director spend time on monthly?\"* Their answer reveals a lot.",
