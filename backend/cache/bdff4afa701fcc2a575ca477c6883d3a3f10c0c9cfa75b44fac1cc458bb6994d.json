  "prompt": "User: we have been moved on to the final stage for a grant and they are doing due diligence. they have asked for our fiscal sponsor's IRS determination letter for tax exemption. Can you share this for SparkWell?\n\nAssistant: **Bottom line:** Yes, this is a standard request. You'll need to contact Anti-Entropy directly to obtain their IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter, as SparkWell participants operate under Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. This is a common requirement during grant due diligence when you're fiscally sponsored. Funders want to verify that their grants to...\n\nUser: What is Sparkwell's Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section?\n\nAssistant: **SparkWell projects operate under IRC Section 501(c)(3)** through Anti-Entropy's tax-exempt status. Since SparkWell is Anti-Entropy's fiscal sponsorship program, all SparkWell projects are covered by Anti-Entropy's 501(c)(3) determination. This means: - Donations to your project are tax-deductible as charitable contributions - Your project operates as part of a charitable organization exempt...\n\nUser: how about a Completed IRS form W-9?\n\nAssistant: **You'll need to request a completed W-9 from Anti-Entropy directly**, as SparkWell projects use Anti-Entropy's tax identification information. The W-9 will show: - **Name:** Anti-Entropy (or their full legal name) - **EIN:** 88-0967420 - **Tax classification:** Typically checked as \"Other\" with \"501(c)(3) nonprofit\" or similar designation **Why funders request this:**...\n\nUser: Does Anti Entropy or Sparkwell do any business in California, such as having employees there and/or soliciting/accepting contributions from California residents?\n\nAssistant: **I don't have specific information about Anti-Entropy's California operations or where they solicit donations.** You'll need to ask Anti-Entropy directly for an accurate answer. **Why this matters:** Funders ask this because organizations that solicit donations from California residents or conduct substantial activities there may need to register with the California...\n\nUser: what should i put for bank account type?",
  "response": "<thinking>The user is asking about what to put for \"bank account type\" - this seems to be continuing their questions about grant due diligence paperwork. They're likely filling out banking information for receiving grant funds.\n\nFor a fiscally sponsored project under SparkWell/Anti-Entropy, the bank account would be Anti-Entropy's account, not the individual project's account. The account type is typically either \"checking\" or \"savings\" - most organizational accounts are checking accounts.\n\nHowever, I should be careful here because:\n1. I don't know the specific bank account details for Anti-Entropy\n2. The user needs to coordinate with Anti-Entropy for this information\n3. This is financial information that needs to be accurate\n\nThe most helpful response would be to:\n- Explain that they need Anti-Entropy's banking information\n- Note that it's typically \"checking\" for organizational accounts\n- Emphasize they should verify with Anti-Entropy\n- Explain why this matters (grants will be disbursed to Anti-Entropy, who then manages funds for the project)</thinking>**You'll need to provide Anti-Entropy's bank account information, and it's most likely \"Checking.\"**\n\n**What you should do:**\n1. **Contact Anti-Entropy** to get their official banking information for receiving grant funds\n2. They'll tell you whether their account is checking or savings (organizational accounts are typically **checking**)\n\n**Important context:**\n- Since you're fiscally sponsored, **grant funds go directly to Anti-Entropy's bank account**, not yours\n- Anti-Entropy then manages and disburses the funds for your project according to your grant agreement\n- This is standard fiscal sponsorship practice - it maintains your tax-exempt status and ensures proper financial oversight\n\n**What Anti-Entropy should provide you:**\n- Bank name\n- Account type (checking or savings)\n- Routing number\n- Account number\n- Account name (likely \"Anti-Entropy\" or their full legal name)\n\n**Pro tip:** Ask Anti-Entropy if they have a standard grant payment information sheet - many fiscal sponsors provide this document that has all the banking details funders commonly request, which will save you time on future grant applications.",
