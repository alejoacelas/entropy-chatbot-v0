Most founders spend 70%+ of their time on operations vs. direct impact.\n\n**Alternative paths with faster impact:**\n- Donate strategically to effective charities\n- Volunteer specialized skills\n- Organize grassroots efforts without formal nonprofit status\n- Start a social enterprise instead\n\n**If you're still interested:** Start small. Run a pilot project, build a track record, prove the concept works. Many successful charities began as informal volunteer efforts.\n\nWhat specific problem are you hoping to address?
