Are there conditions attached?**\n- Grants with no service obligations are more likely to be tax-free\n- Payments contingent on work/services are typically taxable\n\n## Where to Find Definitive Answers\n\n1. **HMRC guidance on scholarships and grants**: Check HMRC's rules on educational grants (EIM06200-06250)\n\n2. **Contact OpenPhil directly**: They may have guidance for UK recipients or have structured these grants with tax treatment in mind\n\n3. **Consult a UK tax advisor**: Given the amounts involved, professional advice is worthwhile. Look for someone familiar with:\n   - Charitable grants\n   - US-UK tax issues (since OpenPhil is US-based)\n\n4. **HMRC helpline**: You can call HMRC directly for guidance on your specific situation\n\n## Practical Suggestion\n\nIf you've received or are applying for one of these grants, I'd recommend asking OpenPhil if they have standard guidance for UK recipients - they've likely addressed this before.\n\nHas anyone else here received one of these grants in the UK?",

          "prompt": "Seeking advice re: moving file-share system to Shared Drives in Google Workspace\nHi everyone, I know there've been threads on adjacent topics before, but they seemed to have a somewhat broader scope to our situation. Currently, most of our files are in a Shared Folder owned by a central account in our Google Workspace. Many of the subfolders and files within are owned by different users. We'd like to move these to Shared Drives.\nI don't want to change anything aside from move all the high-level subfolders within the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. Some of the high-level subfolders would go into an org-wide Shared Drive, while others would go into team-specific Shared Drives. My intent is to simply give all our managers the necessary permissions and ask them to move subfolders from their corner of the Shared Folder into Shared Drives. What should I be looking out for here? Any tips or best practice notes from others who have done the same thing?\nKey pitfalls I'm already aware of are:\nSpecific subfolder permissions won't carry over. All members of the Shared Drive will be able to see everything within it unless a content manager of the Shared Drive goes and specifically changes permissions. We'll need to look out for these where sensitive subfolders are concerned. \nForms with file upload questions will need to stay in My Drive as Shared Drives can't house these for some reason.\nThanks so much for your help :slightly_smiling_face:",
          "response": "# Great that you're planning this migration carefully! Here are some additional considerations:\n\n## Ownership & Permission Issues\n\n**Ownership transfer complications:**\n- Files owned by users who've left the organization can cause issues. You may need to transfer ownership of these files *before* moving to Shared Drives, as you can't move files you don't own.\n- Consider using Google's Drive audit tools or third-party tools to identify orphaned files first.\n\n**External sharing:**\n- Any externally shared links will break when moved to Shared Drives. You'll need to reshare with external users after the move.\n- Document existing external shares beforehand so you can recreate them.\n\n## Technical Limitations\n\n**File/folder limits:**\n- Shared Drives have a 400,000 item limit per drive. Check your folder sizes first.\n- Individual users can only be a member of 100 Shared Drives.\n\n**Shortcuts won't move:**\n- Any shortcuts in the current structure will break and need to be recreated.\n\n**Apps Script & integrations:**\n- Any scripts, third-party integrations, or automated workflows referencing file IDs may break since the file location changes.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Pilot first:**\n- Test with one small team/folder before rolling out org-wide.\n- This helps identify issues specific to your setup.\n\n**Communication plan:**\n- Users should avoid editing files during the migration window.\n- Bookmarks and starred files will need to be updated by users.\n\n**Shared Drive structure:**\n- Set up your Shared Drive permission levels (Manager, Content Manager, Contributor, Commenter, Viewer) *before* moving content.\n- Consider having 2+ managers per Shared Drive to avoid single points of failure.\n\n**Sync issues:**\n- Users with Drive for Desktop may experience sync conflicts during the move. Consider asking them to pause sync temporarily.\n\n## Migration Approach\n\nRather than having managers do this manually, consider:\n- Using Google's **Drive API** or tools like **GAM** for bulk moves (more controlled, auditable)\n- Creating a spreadsheet tracking what's been moved and what hasn't\n- Moving in phases rather than all at once\n\n**One more thing:** Google Takeout backups won't include Shared Drive content by default, so ensure your backup strategy accounts for this change.\n\nGood luck with the migration! 🙂",

Company-owned devices (cleanest approach)**\n- Provide work laptops/phones to staff\n- Full MDM enrollment is straightforward\n- Clear separation of work/personal\n- Can be refurbished/budget devices\n\n**2. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**\n- Staff access work environment via browser/app\n- No data stored on personal devices\n- Can satisfy CE requirements without MDM on personal hardware\n- Services like Azure Virtual Desktop, Amazon WorkSpaces\n\n**3. BYOD-friendly MDM solutions**\n- **Jamf Now** or **Mosyle** for Macs (lighter touch)\n- **Microsoft Intune** with MAM (Mobile Application Management) instead of full MDM\n- Containerized work apps only, doesn't control whole device\n\n**4.

          "response": "# Quick calibration questions:\n\n**Employment context matters most:**\n- Are you self-employed/freelancing, or employed by a company?\n- If employed: Does your company have a travel/expense policy you need to follow?\n- If self-employed: Is this for tax deduction purposes?\n\n**General legitimacy factors:**\n\n✅ **Likely legitimate if:**\n- Primary purpose is business (networking/hosting the unconference)\n- Your company approves business travel expenses\n- You're self-employed and can document business purpose\n- You're prorating if there's personal time mixed in\n\n⚠️ **Needs careful handling:**\n- 3 weeks is long - suggests possible personal component\n- \"Networking\" alone can be fuzzy (vs. the unconference which is clearer)\n- May need to prorate personal vs. business days\n\n**My calibration questions:**\n1. What % of the 3 weeks is directly unconference-related vs. general networking?\n2. Do you live elsewhere (so this is truly travel) or considering a longer NYC stay?\n3. Who are you expensing to - employer, your own business, or tax deduction?\n\nThe unconference hosting is clearly business. The 3-week duration and \"networking\" are what need calibration.

I got an email from one of the SW projects saying: \"assuming this is ok legally I would prefer to just approve by default (particularly for small amounts e.g. sub $100) and just review at the end of the month on our calls.

Payments under £500: Require approval from Project Lead/Manager (or higher)\n2. Payments over £500: Require Director approval\n3. Personal reimbursements: Must be approved by someone other than the payee\n4. Monthly review: All approved payments will be reviewed during monthly calls\n\n**For the specific situation mentioned:**\n\nThe travel reimbursements (some up to £1k) going to the requestor's own account would need to be approved by either:\n- Another Project Lead/Manager (for amounts under £500), OR\n- A Director (for amounts over £500)\n\nThe requestor cannot approve these themselves, even if they have approval authority for other payments.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to adjust the position titles or amounts?",
