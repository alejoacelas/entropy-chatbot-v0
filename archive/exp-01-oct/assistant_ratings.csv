How do I set up a new organization?,"Great question—“organization” can mean a few things. Could you clarify what you’re trying to set up?

- A legal entity (e.g., LLC, corporation, nonprofit) in a specific country/state
- An “organization/workspace” inside a product (e.g., OpenAI, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, Azure)
- An internal org structure (teams, roles, policies) for an existing company
- Something else

If you share which type and your location/jurisdiction (if legal), I’ll give precise step-by-step instructions. In the meantime, here’s a quick high-level checklist for both common scenarios:

If you mean a legal business/nonprofit
- Choose structure: sole prop, LLC, corporation, nonprofit (consider liability, taxes, fundraising).
- Pick a name: check availability (state/country registry + trademark search).
- Appoint a registered agent (if required).
- File formation documents with your state/country (e.g., Articles of Organization/Incorporation).
- Get tax IDs (e.g., EIN) and register for taxes/licenses.
- Draft internal docs: operating agreement/bylaws, founder agreements, equity plan.
- Open a business bank account; set up accounting and payroll.
- Obtain required permits/licenses and insurance.
- Set up compliance calendar (annual reports, taxes, meetings, renewals).

If you mean a workspace inside a tool
- Create the org/workspace from the product’s admin page.
- Verify domain and set SSO/MFA.
- Define roles/permissions, groups, and projects.
- Invite users via domain or SCIM; set default security policies.
- Configure billing, usage limits, and audit logging.
- Set naming conventions and backup/retention.
- Create starter projects/templates and onboarding guides.

Tell me the exact context (tool or jurisdiction), and I’ll tailor the steps and provide links/checklists you can use.","no egregious mistake, doesn't answer my question",2.0,"Great question—there are a few viable paths. A quick check to tailor this: Are you aiming to operate under a fiscal sponsor first or to register a standalone U.S. nonprofit now? And will most funding come from U.S. grantmakers?

High-level options
- Fiscal sponsorship (fastest start): A U.S. 501(c)(3) sponsor receives funds, provides compliance/finance infrastructure, and you run the program under their umbrella. Good for 6–24 months while you validate and fundraise. See models (A, C, L) and fit/exit considerations. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Form a U.S. nonprofit (501(c)(3)): Pick a state, incorporate, get an EIN, adopt bylaws/board, then file IRS Form 1023/1023‑EZ, register for state charity solicitation, set up banking and basic policies. Example step-by-step for New York is here (process is similar across states with state-specific differences). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))
- Stay based outside the U.S. but take U.S. grants: Many U.S. funders use Equivalency Determination (ED) or Expenditure Responsibility. If you remain a Colombia entity initially, an ED certificate can streamline grants from U.S. foundations. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

Suggested path for your stage (early, 2 FTE, seeking Open Phil grant)
- Short term (0–3 months): Pursue fiscal sponsorship to receive funds quickly and stand up operations with lean overhead; choose the model that matches your control/risk appetite. In parallel, decide whether you’ll transition to your own U.S. entity within 6–18 months. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If forming a U.S. org: Select a state, draft articles and bylaws, recruit a 3+ person board, file incorporation, get EIN, submit 1023/1023‑EZ, and complete state charity registration. Use the NY checklist article as a reference for ongoing compliance items you’ll need in any state. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))
- If remaining non‑U.S. initially: Scope ED requirements (governing docs, 3–5 years financials, public‑support tests) and timeline, or confirm funders are comfortable with Expenditure Responsibility instead.

Next steps I can help with
- Map a 60–90 day launch plan for either track (FS vs. 501(c)(3)).
- Draft your incorporation/board/baseline policy checklist.
- If you share your preferred U.S. state (or confirm you’ll start with fiscal sponsorship), I’ll tailor the exact steps and documents to prepare.","concise response, makes good use of links. offers third option for Equivalency Determination",5.0,"Great question. “Set up” can mean different things (fiscal sponsorship vs. your own legal entity; US vs. non‑US). Given your context (EA‑aligned nonprofit work, Colombia‑based, likely US registration, considering fiscal sponsorship, Open Phil grant), here’s a concise, practical roadmap with decision points and links to deeper resources.

First, three quick choices to make
- Where to anchor the org legally for the next 12–24 months? Most peers start under a US fiscal sponsor, then spin out.
- What level of independence do you need now vs. later? This determines the sponsorship model or entity type.
- Where will staff legally sit and be paid (US, Colombia, mixed)? This affects compliance and HR setup.

Path A (fastest): Start under a fiscal sponsor, then spin out
- Why: You can accept grants and start operating within weeks, while the sponsor handles charity compliance, finance, and HR. Typical fee is 5–15% of incoming funds. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Pick the right model:
  - Model A (comprehensive): sponsor fully houses the project and staff.
  - Model C (pre‑approved grant): you remain a separate project/entity; sponsor regrants with oversight.
  - Model L (single‑member LLC owned by sponsor): maximizes project control with limited sponsor liability. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Immediate steps (2–4 weeks typical):
  - Short concept note (mission, activities, budget, risks), initial policies (CoI, code of conduct), draft grant terms.
  - Apply to a sponsor aligned with your mission; confirm services, fees, HR options for Colombia‑based staff, banking, and exit terms. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))
- Use these resources:
  - Fiscal sponsorship models overview + apply/exit guidance. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
  - SparkWell resource set (starter frameworks/checklists for the first year). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/sparkwell-resources?utm_source=openai))

Path B (more independence): Form your own US nonprofit now
- Typical sequence (many do this while operating under a sponsor):
  1) Choose a state and incorporate a nonprofit corporation; appoint initial board; adopt bylaws and a conflicts policy. 2) Get EIN. 3) Apply for 501(c)(3) status (Form 1023 or 1023‑EZ, 3–12 months typical). 4) Open bank, set up accounting. 5) Register for charitable solicitations in relevant states. 6) Put baseline policies in place (conduct, safeguarding, whistleblowing). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))
- Example state guidance and checklists (New York shown as a model: incorporation, AG charity registration, fees, documents). Similar how‑tos exist for other states. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

Cross‑cutting operational pieces you’ll want regardless of path
- Governance basics: a functioning board, bylaws, conflicts policy, and minutes from your organizing meeting. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-charity-conflict-of-interest?utm_source=openai))
- Grant readiness: know your grantor’s requirements; under sponsorship, confirm who signs; as a standalone, ensure your 501(c)(3) status or the grantor’s compliance path. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))
- Baseline conduct/safety policies (often required by funders and venues). You can adapt ready‑to‑use templates. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/code-of-conduct-for-management-of-offices-co-working-spaces?utm_source=openai))
- Tools and discounts: set up nonprofit discounts for core software (email, PM, comms) via TechSoup/partners. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))

A pragmatic 90‑day plan (optimized for your situation)
- Weeks 1–2: Decide Path A vs. B. If Path A, shortlist 2–3 aligned sponsors and prepare a 2–3 page concept + budget + risk notes. If Path B, choose state, draft bylaws and CoI, prepare incorporation filing. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Weeks 3–6: Submit sponsor applications (or file incorporation + EIN). Stand up basic policies and internal docs. Start software stack with nonprofit discounts. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))
- Weeks 7–12: If sponsored, finalize onboarding and start program delivery; if standalone, submit 501(c)(3) application and begin state charitable registrations. In both cases, confirm how Open Phil funds will be received and reported. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

Given your current stage, I recommend Path A now (fiscal sponsorship, likely Model A or C), begin program work as soon as October–November 2025, and draft a spin‑out plan for late 2026 if traction and funding persist. This minimizes setup risk, matches your desire for operational support, and meets likely funder timelines. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

If helpful, I can:
- Draft a 2–3 page sponsor application packet (mission, activities, budget, risk/mitigation, requested services).
- Generate a lightweight policy bundle (code of conduct, conflicts, safeguarding) and a board/budget starter kit.
- Map sponsor options and outreach emails tailored to EA‑aligned sponsors.

Quick clarifiers for you
- Which country/state do you want to anchor legal operations in for the next 12 months?
- Do you need the sponsor to employ staff in Colombia, or will you start with contractor arrangements?
- What is your target go‑live date and the earliest date Open Phil funds could land?",links right resources. Gives various useful details. a bit too long,4.0
In which country should I establish my organization?,"Great question—“best country” depends on what you’re building and where you’ll operate. Share a few details and I’ll give you a tailored 2–3 country shortlist with next steps. Quick questions:
- For-profit, nonprofit, or hybrid/social enterprise?
- What do you sell and where are your customers located now/next 24 months?
- Where are founders/directors resident for tax and immigration?
- Do you expect venture investors? If yes, from where?
- Need to hire locally or globally? Any data residency or regulated activity (fintech/health/education)?
- Priorities: lowest taxes, easiest setup/compliance, investor acceptance, grants, IP protection, or lifestyle/visa?
- Revenue model (SaaS, marketplace, consulting, hardware), expected cross‑border payments, and need for Stripe/PayPal?
- Do you need limited liability right away and the ability to issue equity options?

Common, proven choices by scenario (high-level)
- Global SaaS aiming for VC: United States (Delaware C‑Corp) for investor familiarity, stock options, and U.S. payments; UK (Ltd) as a strong alternative in Europe; Singapore (Pte Ltd) for Asia access and banking.
- Bootstrapped remote tech with worldwide customers: Estonia (OU via e‑Residency) for low-friction digital admin and EU VAT handling; UK (Ltd) for simplicity and treaties; Singapore for efficient banking and territorial tax.
- Selling mainly to the EU: Ireland or Netherlands for EU market, IP regimes, and talent; Estonia/UK for ease and cost.
- Asia-Pacific first: Singapore or Hong Kong for banking, treaties, and low corporate tax; Australia if selling to AU consumers (consumer law/GST).
- Nonprofit/charity: United States (501(c)(3)) for grant access and donor deductibility; UK (Charity/CIO) for European trust; Netherlands (ANBI) for EU donors.
- Social enterprise: Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (US), UK CIC, or Italy “Società Benefit” for mission lock with standard company features.
- Consulting/agency/freelance: Your country of residence (to avoid complex CFC issues), or UK/Estonia if you lack a reliable local structure.
- Hardware/manufacturing: US, Germany, or Singapore for IP enforcement and customs; consider where assembly/import duties and certifications will apply.

Key factors to weigh
- Tax and treaties: corporate rate, withholding taxes, and your personal residency/CFC rules.
- Compliance load: bookkeeping, audits, payroll/VAT/GST thresholds.
- Banking/fintech rails: ease of opening accounts, Stripe/PayPal availability, stable currency.
- Hiring and equity: option plans, contractor vs employee rules, visas.
- IP and data: enforcement strength, data transfer rules (e.g., GDPR) and any data-localization needs.
- Substance: many countries now require real operations (directors, office, payroll) for treaty benefits.

If you give me:
- your industry and product,
- where founders live,
- top 3 customer regions,
- whether you’ll raise VC,
- near-term headcount and where,

I’ll propose a ranked shortlist with pros/cons, estimated setup/compliance costs, and immediate steps to incorporate and open banking.",doesn't know enough about me to answer,1.0,"Short answer: Given your situation (based in Colombia, two founders, first-year grant expected from a U.S. funder), most projects like yours start under a U.S. fiscal sponsor for 6–24 months, then decide whether to form their own U.S. 501(c)(3) or keep operating internationally. This balances speed, funder fit, banking, and compliance. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Why this is often the best first step
- Fastest path to receive U.S. grants and set up compliant finance/reporting without waiting for IRS approval. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Keeps overhead low while you validate demand and refine your model. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- You can choose a sponsorship model with more autonomy (Model C or Model L) if you want clearer separation or your own bank account under a sponsor. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Alternative you could consider now
- Incorporate in Colombia (or stay unincorporated) and receive the Open Phil grant directly as a non‑U.S. organization. The funder would need to use “equivalency determination” (ED) or “expenditure responsibility.” ED streamlines future U.S. fundraising but requires substantial documentation and may be hard for brand‑new orgs. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

How to decide: quick decision grid
- Primary funders next 12–24 months are U.S.-based and expect charity-equivalent compliance and easy grant processing → start with U.S. fiscal sponsorship.
- You need your own legal entity now (e.g., for IP ownership, certain contracts) but still want U.S. donation flow → ask sponsors about Model L (single‑member LLC) or use Model C with clear roles. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- You plan to stay primarily Colombia‑based and have a pathway to ED → consider forming in Colombia and pursuing ED once you have operating history. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

Suggested next steps
1) Confirm whether Open Phil prefers paying a U.S. 501(c)(3)/fiscal sponsor for your first grant.  
2) If yes, identify 2–3 fiscal sponsors aligned with your mission; ask about Model C vs. Model L, fees, banking, hiring in Colombia, and exit terms. Start here: Fiscal Sponsorship Models and Applying/Exiting guides. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))  
3) In parallel, sketch your 12–18 month “entity plan” (stay sponsored; form U.S. nonprofit; or register in Colombia and use ED later). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

A couple of clarifying questions so I can tailor this:
- Do you want to hire locally in Colombia in the next 6–12 months, or will you use contractors?  
- Is the Open Phil grant intended for you as a project under a sponsor, or are they open to funding a non‑U.S. entity directly?

If helpful, I can draft a one‑page decision memo comparing: U.S. fiscal sponsorship vs. immediate U.S. 501(c)(3) vs. Colombia entity + ED, including costs, timelines, and operational implications. Note: This is general guidance, not legal/tax advice.",appropriately dissuaded me of equivalency determination. was concise and tried to anticipate my needs,5.0,"Short answer: Start in the U.S. via fiscal sponsorship now; decide later whether to spin out a standalone U.S. nonprofit. Keep Colombian ops light (contractors/EOR) unless you need a Colombian entity for local hiring or grants.

Why this fits your situation
- Fastest way to accept Open Phil (U.S.) funding and give U.S. donors tax deductibility without waiting months for 501(c)(3) status. Good fiscal sponsors handle banking, payroll, and compliance while you validate the model. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Lower administrative burden while you’re early stage and short on ops capacity; sponsors provide policies, finance, and guardrails. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- You can pilot for 6–12 months, then either remain hosted or incorporate your own U.S. entity (common next step). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))

What the next 12 months could look like
- Months 0–1: Apply to a U.S. fiscal sponsor (Model A or C). Use their EIN, bank, and compliance to receive the Open Phil grant and start work. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Months 3–6: Operate and collect evidence of time/cost savings (your success metrics). If you must hire in Colombia, use contractors or an employer-of-record while hosted.
- Months 6–12: If the model is working and funding looks durable, form a U.S. nonprofit (commonly DE or NY/NJ/CA for practical reasons) and file for 501(c)(3); transition from sponsor when your admin load is predictable. Example state setup requirements are here (NY guide). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

Alternatives and when to pick them
- Incorporate in Colombia first: Only if most staff and funders are Colombian or you need a local entity to sign contracts/hire. Note that raising from U.S. private foundations is doable but often slower unless you obtain an Equivalency Determination (ED) or the funder is willing to do expenditure responsibility. ED adds documentation and costs. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))
- Incorporate in the UK (CIO/charity): Consider only if your donor base is UK‑centric and you need Gift Aid; banking and compliance are heavier early, and visa sponsorship adds overhead. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-nonprofit-charity-compliance-checklist?utm_source=openai))
- EU entities (e.g., NL Stichting/ANBI, DE gGmbH): Useful for EU donors or operations; otherwise they add friction for a U.S.-funded, remote-first org.

Key trade-offs to keep in mind
- Speed to first dollar in the bank: U.S. fiscal sponsorship is usually fastest. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Donor tax benefits: U.S. donors expect 501(c)(3) deductibility (achieved immediately via sponsor). UK donors care about Gift Aid (requires UK setup or host). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Compliance capacity: Sponsorship offloads finance, policy, and filings; direct incorporation shifts that to you. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

If you want, I can:
- Shortlist 3–5 reputable U.S. fiscal sponsors that fit EA-aligned projects and compare Model A vs. C terms.
- Map the spin‑out plan (timeline, filings, policies) when you’re ready to incorporate your own U.S. entity.

Quick clarifiers to finalize the recommendation
1) Where will your first 2–3 hires live? 2) Do you expect >75% of funding from U.S. sources for the next 24 months? 3) Do you need UK/EU tax‑deductible giving this year?",appropriately dissuaded me of equivalency determination. was concise and tried to anticipate my needs,5.0
Can I be a non-profit if I receive money from my clients? Should I be a for-profit? How much does it matter?,"Short answer: yes, a nonprofit can charge for services and receive money from clients. The key question isn’t “do you take revenue?”—it’s whether your organization is organized and operated primarily for a charitable/mission purpose (not to benefit private owners) and how profits are used.

Big picture (U.S.-centric; tell me your country/state if different):
- Nonprofit (e.g., 501(c)(3) charity)
  - Allowed revenue: Donations, grants, and earned revenue (fees, ticket sales, product/service income) are all allowed if they further the mission.
  - Musts: No owners/shareholders; no private inurement (profits can’t be distributed to insiders). Surpluses are reinvested in the mission.
  - Taxes: Exempt on mission-related income; pay tax on unrelated business income (UBIT). May have sales/property tax breaks. Donations are typically tax-deductible for donors.
  - Fundraising: Eligible for grants and charitable gifts; cannot offer equity.
  - Risks: If your activities look primarily commercial and not mission-driven, exemption can be denied/jeopardized. You may need to pass “public support” tests if you want 501(c)(3) status.
- For-profit (LLC/Corp/Benefit Corp)
  - Allowed revenue: Any lawful business activity; profits can be distributed to owners.
  - Taxes: Pay income taxes on profits; no donor tax deductions. Simpler rules on pricing and activities.
  - Fundraising: Can raise equity/accept investment; more flexible compensation/ownership structures.
  - Mission: You can still be impact-focused; a Benefit Corporation/legal “public benefit” form can embed mission, and B Corp is a certification you can pursue.

How much does the choice matter?
- It matters a lot for taxes, governance/ownership, funding options, and compliance.
- Choose nonprofit if: Your core purpose is charitable/educational/community benefit; you plan to reinvest surpluses; you need grants/donations; and your fee-for-service directly advances the mission (e.g., low-cost counseling, museum tickets, training for underserved groups).
- Choose for-profit if: You expect primarily commercial revenue, want to distribute profits or raise investment, need pricing/operational flexibility, or your market is mostly customers rather than donors/grantmakers.

Common edge cases and tools:
- Fee-for-service at market rates can still fit a nonprofit if it primarily advances the mission and includes community benefit (e.g., scholarships, sliding-scale pricing, serving a charitable class).
- Unrelated Business Income: If you sell things not substantially related to the mission, that slice may be taxable (and if it dominates, your exemption can be at risk).
- Hybrids/alternatives: Fiscal sponsorship (operate under an existing 501(c)(3) while you test the model), a dual-entity structure (nonprofit + for-profit subsidiary), Benefit Corporation, or L3C (in a few states) to attract impact investment.

Quick decision checklist:
1) Mission first: Can you clearly articulate the charitable/public benefit your activities achieve? Who benefits?
2) Revenue mix: Roughly what % will be donations/grants vs. fees/sales over the next 3 years?
3) Pricing/market: Are you serving a charitable class or providing below-market/accessible services? Any sliding scale?
4) Capital needs: Do you need equity investment? If yes, nonprofit is usually not a fit.
5) Governance: Are you comfortable with a mission-driven board that controls the organization (no owners)?
6) Compliance appetite: Nonprofits have specific filing and fundraising rules; for-profits have fewer mission constraints but pay taxes and can’t offer donor deductions.

If you share:
- Your location (country/state),
- Your mission and who you serve,
- Expected revenue sources and percentages,
- Whether you need grants/donations or equity,
I can suggest a tailored structure and flag any state-specific issues. This isn’t legal or tax advice, but I can outline next steps and questions for an attorney/CPA.",longer response. harder to parse,3.0,"Short answer: Yes—U.S. nonprofits can charge clients and earn revenue. What matters is whether the fees further your charitable purpose and how large any unrelated commercial activity becomes.

A couple of quick clarifiers to tailor this: 
- Where do you plan to register first (U.S. vs Colombia), and do you expect most income from grants or from client fees in year 1–2?

How nonprofits can earn fees
- Program service revenue is normal for 501(c)(3)s if the activity directly advances the mission (e.g., delivering AI enablement services to EA-aligned nonprofits). This counts as public support in U.S. charity tests. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))
- If you sell services unrelated to the mission and do so regularly, that income is “unrelated business income” and is taxable (UBIT). Too much unrelated activity can threaten exemption. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-defined?utm_source=openai))
- Regardless of fees, a 501(c)(3) cannot distribute profits to founders or insiders (no private inurement/private benefit beyond incidental). ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/inurement-private-benefit-charitable-organizations?utm_source=openai))

When a for-profit can make more sense
- If your core model is selling market-rate services to a broad set of customers (not primarily charitable beneficiaries), raising investment, sharing profits/equity, or pivoting fast on commercial offerings, a for-profit LLC/C‑corp may be simpler.
- Tradeoffs: for-profits generally can’t receive tax‑deductible donations and many foundations prefer or require a 501(c)(3) recipient (directly or via a fiscal sponsor). If you’ll rely on philanthropy (e.g., initial grants) and your services primarily benefit charitable organizations, nonprofit or fiscal sponsorship is usually smoother. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Practical paths for your stage
- Start under a fiscal sponsor while you validate demand and funding; you can charge mission‑aligned fees and accept grants immediately, then decide later whether to incorporate your own 501(c)(3) or spin out a for‑profit arm. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If mostly grant‑funded with some cost‑recovery fees to nonprofits, a 501(c)(3) (or fiscal sponsorship) fits well; track fee activities and file Form 990‑T if any unrelated income exceeds thresholds. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax?utm_source=openai))
- Hybrid: a 501(c)(3) with a for‑profit subsidiary for clearly commercial lines is common once you scale.

What I recommend next
- Share your expected year‑1 revenue mix (grants vs client fees, who the clients are, % mission‑advancing vs commercial). I can map it to “nonprofit-only,” “for‑profit,” or “hybrid” with pros/cons and first steps, and point you to any UBIT guardrails relevant to your plan.

Give me initial suggestions of fiscal sponsors for my project,"Great—fiscal sponsorship options vary a lot by project type, location, budget, and urgency. If you share a few details, I can tailor a shortlist. Quick questions:
- Where will the project operate (country/state), and do you need a U.S. 501(c)(3) home?
- What’s the project type (arts, tech/open-source, journalism, environment, social services, advocacy/501(c)(4), etc.)?
- Expected annual budget and first‑year funding sources (grants, donations, earned revenue)?
- Do you need payroll/HR, insurance, or just donation/grant processing?
- Ideal start date and any grant deadlines?

Initial suggestions by category (reputable, broad coverage):
- Cross‑sector (U.S., multiple services): Tides Center; Social Good Fund; TSNE Fiscal Sponsorship; Urban Affairs Coalition; United Charitable; Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs (SEE).
- Arts/culture/creative: Fractured Atlas; New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA); Allied Media Projects (media/arts with movement focus).
- Environment/conservation: Earth Island Institute; Rainforest Alliance’s fiscal programs are limited—often EII or SEE fit better for grassroots.
- Tech/open‑source/R&D: Software Freedom Conservancy; NumFOCUS (scientific/open‑source); Code for Science & Society (data/civic tech).
- Journalism/news: Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) fiscal sponsorship; Investigative Reporters & Editors (select programs).
- Film/documentary: International Documentary Association (IDA); Women Make Movies (WMM).
- Philanthropy/collaboratives and larger budgets: New Venture Fund; Proteus Fund (issue‑focused programs).

How to vet/compare (use this as a checklist):
- Sponsorship model: Model A (comprehensive, sponsor employs staff) vs Model C (pre‑approved grant relationship). Which do you need?
- Fees: Typical 5–15% on restricted funds; ask about minimums, pass‑through rates, credit‑card fees, and additional HR/benefits costs.
- Onboarding speed: Range is 2–10+ weeks; confirm timeline for grant deadlines.
- Services: Payroll/HR, benefits, insurance (GL/D&O/Auto/Workers’ Comp), contract review, AP/AR, audits, donor CRM, grants management.
- Governance/control: Policies on advisory boards, spending authority, IP ownership, branding, and data.
- Fund eligibility: Any geographic or funder restrictions; ability to accept international donations or non‑cash assets.
- Reporting/compliance: Cadence of financials, budget tools, 990 roll‑up, and audit support.
- Exit options: Spin‑out pathways to your own 501(c)(3) or another entity; asset/IP transfer terms.

- Are you looking for comprehensive “Model A” support (HR/payroll, contracting, insurance) or lighter “Model C” grant",asked quick follow-up. didn't answer my question,2.0,"Great fit fiscal sponsors to consider first (for an EA‑aligned, US‑based project with founders in Colombia)

EA‑aligned or EA‑familiar
- Rethink Priorities – Special Projects (Model A; full‑stack ops + fiscal sponsorship). Typical fees start at 14% with ability to hire in the US/UK or internationally via Employer of Record; they explicitly sponsor AI and global priorities projects. Strong for speed, compliance, and donor credibility in EA circles. ([rethinkpriorities.org](https://rethinkpriorities.org/our-services/special-projects/?utm_source=openai))

Large, generalist US 501(c)(3) sponsors
- Tides Center – Mature, comprehensive sponsor (Model A) with 9% standard fee; 15% on government funds. Requires a US base and does not employ outside the US/territories, so confirm fit if most staff will sit abroad. ([tides.org](https://www.tides.org/fiscal-sponsorship-at-tides/?utm_source=openai))
- TSNE (MissionWorks) – Full shared‑services sponsor; first‑year indirect rate 14% (reassessed; floor 10%). Eligibility limits if >20% of staff are abroad or if services/programs run primarily outside the US. Good processes, but may not fit an internationally distributed team. ([tsne.org](https://tsne.org/FAQ/?utm_source=openai))

Lean/fast‑onboard generalists (often permissive on geography)
- Players Philanthropy Fund (PPF) – Streamlined onboarding in ~2 weeks; 6% on deposits, requires a $5,000 opening deposit. Broad portfolio in 35+ countries; good for donor receipts and contractor payments. ([ppf.org](https://www.ppf.org/fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))
- EarthShare – Offers Model A/C with 6–10% admin; explicitly supports hiring US and international employees/contractors with HR support. ([earthshare.org](https://www.earthshare.org/fiscal-sponsorship/?utm_source=openai))
- United Charitable – Typical fee 10% of donations (plus application/annual fees per directory listing). Works across many program types, including international development.

Issue‑ or sector‑focused sponsors (consider if mission‑aligned)
- Social & Environmental Entrepreneurs (SEE) – Environmental/social‑justice focus; public materials reference a 6.5% fiscal fee with added charges for some services.

Which documents do I need to get ready to create and register a nonprofit,"Great question—requirements vary by country and (in the U.S.) by state, but here’s a concise checklist of what most nonprofits need to prepare before filing. Tell me your location and I’ll tailor it precisely.

Core items you’ll likely need anywhere
- Purpose and mission statement: 1–3 sentences describing what you do and who you serve.
- Organization name: plus 2–3 backups; check availability.
- Board of directors list: names, addresses, roles; confirm minimum number required locally.
- Articles/Certificate of Incorporation: your formation document for the government registry.
- Bylaws: internal governance rules (meetings, elections, officers, conflicts, dissolution).
- Conflict of Interest Policy: signed by directors annually.
- Initial Board Resolutions/Minutes: adopting bylaws, appointing officers, authorizing filings.
- Registered agent and office address.

If you’re in the United States (typical 501(c)(3) pathway)
State level
- Articles of Incorporation with required 501(c)(3) clauses (purpose and dissolution).
- Name reservation (optional in many states).
- Registered agent appointment.
- State filing fee.
- Charitable solicitation registration (if fundraising in that state).
- State tax exemptions (sales/use, property, state income—file after IRS approval in some states).

Federal (IRS)
- Employer Identification Number (EIN): even with no employees.
- IRS tax-exempt application: Form 1023 or 1023-EZ (for small orgs that qualify), or other 1024-series for non-501(c)(3) types.
- Required attachments for the IRS filing:
  - Finalized bylaws and articles (with specific 501(c)(3) language).
  - Narrative of activities (program descriptions).
  - Proposed budget (typically 3 years) and revenue sources.
  - Compensation/insider transactions details (if any).

Recommended supporting documents/policies
- 12–24 month operating plan and simple business plan.
- Annual budget and cash-flow forecast.
- Donor acknowledgment/receipt template (with quid pro quo language if needed).
- Whistleblower and document retention policies.
- Fiscal sponsorship agreement (only if applicable).
- Grant/fundraising plan and basic branding assets.
- Insurance quote(s) (general liability, D&O).
- Compliance calendar (annual report deadlines, IRS Form 990 series).

Common early steps to line up
- Open a bank account (requires EIN and usually bylaws + board resolution).
- Set up bookkeeping (chart of accounts suited for nonprofits).
- Obtain permits/licenses specific to your activities (events, raffles, etc.).
- Build your board onboarding packet and meeting schedule.

Want me to tailor this to your state/country and nonprofit type (public charity, private foundation, trade association, etc.)? Tell me where you’re registering and your expected first-year revenue.",Comment: focused on being a 501(c)3 myself. don't care about that,1.0,"Great question—this is very doable. A couple quick clarifiers will make the list precise:
- Where will you register in the US (which state)? Requirements and filings vary by state.
- Are you aiming for a 501(c)(3) public charity this year, or considering fiscal sponsorship first?

Core documents most new US nonprofits prepare
Incorporation and governance
- Organization name (confirmed available in your chosen state)
- Registered agent details (name/address in the state of incorporation)
- Articles/Certificate of Incorporation with 501(c)(3) purpose and dissolution clauses
- Initial board roster (usually 3+ directors; varies by state)
- Bylaws (your operating rules)
- Initial board consent/minutes adopting bylaws and appointing officers
- Conflict of Interest policy (commonly requested alongside bylaws)
- Optional: Board officer job descriptions and a simple governance calendar

Federal tax exemption (IRS)
- EIN (Employer Identification Number)
- Form 1023 or 1023‑EZ package, including:
  - Narrative of activities (what you’ll do, how, who benefits)
  - 3‑year projected budgets (revenue and expenses)
  - Compensation/arrangements disclosures for officers/related parties
  - Organizing documents showing required clauses (as filed) and bylaws
- After approval: keep the IRS Determination Letter on file (funders will ask for it)

State registrations (vary by state)
- Charitable solicitation registration (often with the Attorney General/Charities Bureau)
- State tax exemptions (sales/use, property—if applicable)
- Any required initial/annual corporate reports
- City/county business registrations if required for your operations

Banking and admin
- Board banking resolution
- Signature cards and KYC documents for the bank
- Basic financial controls (expense/reimbursement policy; simple chart of accounts)

Why this list
- These are the items states and the IRS typically require to create the entity, obtain 501(c)(3), and fundraise legally. For example, New York’s setup checklist calls out Articles, a registered agent, board members, and bylaws, followed by EIN, IRS exemption, and NY charitable registration. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

Alternatives you may want to consider (given you’re based in Colombia)
- Fiscal sponsorship: lets you accept grants and operate under a sponsor’s 501(c)(3) while you pilot the project; useful if Open Phil funding is time‑sensitive. See the Portal’s overview of models and application/exit considerations. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If you instead form outside the US and seek US funding, some foundations may use equivalency determination (ED) rather than require a US entity. The Portal explains ED, documents needed, and tradeoffs. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

Next steps I recommend
1) Pick your state (common choices for remote teams are DE, DC, or your primary operating state). I can tailor the exact forms and fees once you choose.
2) Draft your Articles, bylaws, and Conflict of Interest policy; schedule a brief board meeting to adopt them.
3) File incorporation, get an EIN, then file Form 1023/1023‑EZ.
4) Complete your state’s charitable registration before soliciting donations/grants there.
5) Open a bank account and put simple financial controls in place.

Want me to provide a state-specific packet (completed Articles template with required IRS clauses, bylaws, COI policy, initial minutes, and a 1023‑EZ eligibility check)? If you share your target state and timeline, I’ll tailor it to you.","didn't explore the possibility of a fiscal sponsorship, which is the path I'm most interested on",2.0,"Short answer: it depends on your jurisdiction and whether you’ll use fiscal sponsorship first. If you tell me your country and (if USA) the state you plan to register in, I’ll tailor this to you.

Below is a practical, “pack your folder” checklist you can start assembling now. It covers two common paths for EA‑aligned projects: 1) using a fiscal sponsor to get moving quickly, and 2) forming a standalone U.S. 501(c)(3).

Path A — If you start under a fiscal sponsor (fastest)
Have these ready for the application and onboarding:
- 1–2 page concept note: mission, activities for the next 12 months, who benefits, risks/mitigations.
- Draft budget and funding plan: sources, major cost lines, cashflow assumptions.
- Governance snapshot: project lead(s), any advisors, decision rights you’re seeking.
- Safeguarding and conduct commitments: agree to sponsor policies; list any higher‑risk activities (minors, events, travel).
- Operational needs: whether you need the sponsor to employ staff/contractors, handle grants, or reimburse expenses.
- Exit/transition intent: whether you intend to spin out, and rough timing.
Notes: Common models are “Model A (comprehensive)” and “Model C (pre‑approved grant)”—each has different control, risk, and fees (often 5–15%). Read before choosing. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Path B — If you form a standalone U.S. nonprofit (aiming for 501(c)(3))
You’ll typically need, in this order:

1) Pre‑incorporation prep
- Organization name options (and name search results).
- Clear charitable purpose statement and 1–3 sentence mission.
- Initial board list: at least 3 independent directors is common; officers (president/chair, secretary, treasurer). Non‑US directors are allowed; you’ll still need a U.S. registered agent/address.
- Registered agent details (state of incorporation).
- Program description: initial activities, who you serve, where you’ll operate.
- 3‑year projected budget (revenue and expenses).
- Basic policies you intend to adopt: conflict of interest; whistleblower; document retention; codes of conduct/safeguarding if relevant. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-charity-conflict-of-interest?utm_source=openai))

2) Form the legal entity at the state level
- Articles/Certificate of Incorporation with IRS‑compliant clauses: specific 501(c)(3) purpose and asset‑dissolution clause.
- Incorporator statement and initial board consent.
- Bylaws approved by the board.
- Organizational meeting minutes (or unanimous written consent).
- State filing receipt. Some states have charity‑specific steps; for example, New York has extra agency consents and attorney‑general registration. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

3) Get your EIN (federal tax ID)
- IRS Form SS‑4 (can be done online). You’ll need a “responsible party” with identifying info (SSN/ITIN or foreign TIN acceptable).

4) Apply for federal tax exemption
- IRS Form 1023 or 1023‑EZ eligibility worksheet.
- Narrative of activities: who/what/where/how, including grantmaking if any.
- 3‑year financials: projections (new orgs) and any actuals to date.
- Compensation and insider‑transactions disclosures; board independence.
- Copies of Articles and Bylaws (as filed/adopted).
- Required schedules (e.g., public charity status, schools/hospitals, foreign activities or grants).
- Filing fee payment and signature by an officer.

5) State charity registration and ongoing state filings
- Register with your state charity regulator before or shortly after soliciting donations (AG/Charities Bureau in many states).
- Typical uploads: Articles, Bylaws, IRS determination letter (once received), officer/board info, program description, fee.
- Expect annual state charity reports and, once you have revenue, CPA review/audit thresholds (these vary by state; e.g., NY has tiered requirements). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

6) Banking, donations, and operations
- Bank account resolutions and KYC: Articles, EIN letter, Bylaws, board minutes, IDs for control persons.
- Gift acceptance and receipting process; acknowledgment templates.
- If fundraising online nationally, evaluate multi‑state charity registrations.
- Set up core ops: bookkeeping, expense",3,3.0
Do I need to be a registered entity before receiving funds from Open Philanthropy?,"Short answer: No. You don’t have to be a registered nonprofit to receive Open Philanthropy funding.

Details and common paths:
- Individuals and informal projects can be funded. Some Open Phil RFPs explicitly accept applications from individuals worldwide. Grants to non‑charitable entities just require extra legal diligence. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/request-for-proposals-ai-governance/?utm_source=openai))
- If you’re not a U.S. 501(c)(3), Open Phil (via its funding partners) can often fund you using Expenditure Responsibility (ER) or, for non‑U.S. orgs, via an Equivalency Determination (ED). These are standard compliance mechanisms for funding entities that aren’t recognized U.S. public charities. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-regranting-challenge/?utm_source=openai))
- Grants are typically paid through external partners (e.g., Silicon Valley Community Foundation or Good Ventures), which run legal due diligence. More complex cases (individuals, universities, international recipients, lobbying, etc.) can take longer to process. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grantmaking-process/?utm_source=openai))
- If you use a fiscal sponsor, Open Phil focuses compliance on your sponsored project rather than the sponsor’s entire organization. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/what-to-expect-gcrcb/?utm_source=openai))

If you share where you’re based and whether you’re applying as an individual or a group, I can suggest the smoothest route (e.g., fiscal sponsorship vs. ER/ED) and what documents you’ll likely need.",great use of external links to OP material. short and to the point,4.0,"Short answer: Not necessarily. Open Philanthropy can fund individuals, fiscally sponsored projects, or organizations. You don’t have to be a registered entity if Open Phil is comfortable funding you as an individual or via a fiscal sponsor. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/career-development-and-transition-funding/?utm_source=openai))

Key options (and what they mean for you, Colombia-based and planning US registration):
- Individual grant: Possible under certain Open Phil programs. Expect additional compliance on their side and personal tax implications for you (Colombian taxes; possibly U.S. reporting depending on structure). Ask Open Phil which vehicle they intend to use. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/career-development-and-transition-funding/?utm_source=openai))
- Fiscal sponsorship (common/easiest early path): A U.S. 501(c)(3) sponsor receives the funds and subgrants/hosts your project. This minimizes setup time and satisfies U.S. charitable compliance. Fees typically 5–15%. See overview and models. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))
- Your own non-U.S. entity: U.S. funders can still grant, but they must use either Equivalency Determination (ED) or Expenditure Responsibility (ER). Without being a recognized charity, ED isn’t available; ER is still possible but adds monitoring/agreements. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))
- Your own U.S. 501(c)(3): Viable but slower. Consider later once you’ve validated the model and pipeline.

Why this matters
- U.S. private foundation rules: Grants to non-charities require ER; grants to individuals require approved procedures under IRC 4945(g). Open Phil can and does fund individuals in some cases, but structure affects reporting and restrictions. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/grants-by-private-foundations-expenditure-responsibility?utm_source=openai))

- Equivalency Determination for non-U.S. grantees (what ED is and when it helps). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))
- Fiscal Sponsorship: models and how to apply/exit. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Recommended next steps
1. Ask Open Phil which vehicle they’re proposing (individual grant, sponsor, or direct org grant). If they’re open to fiscal sponsorship, that’s usually simplest at your stage.
2. If pursuing a sponsor, I can suggest a short list and help you prep a 1–2 page project brief sponsors expect.
3. If you prefer to receive funds personally, speak with a Colombian tax advisor about income treatment and estimated taxes; we can draft",link to OP material was irrelevant,3.0,"Short answer: No. Open Philanthropy can and does fund individuals and fiscally sponsored projects, not only registered nonprofits. They’ve publicly recorded grants to individuals (e.g., AI work/study support; Century Fellowship) and note that grants may be paid via their advised fund at SVCF, Open Philanthropy’s own 501(c)(3), Good Ventures, or the 501(c)(4) Action Fund, depending on the case. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/ai-funding-for-individuals-work-and-study-support/?utm_source=openai))

What this means for you (based in Colombia, planning US registration)
- Fastest compliant path: use a reputable fiscal sponsor (Model A or C). This is common for early-stage projects and simplifies the funder’s diligence, disbursement, and reporting. See overviews of fiscal sponsorship models and apply/exit considerations. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If you form your own entity later (US or Colombia), Open Phil (as a private foundation or via its DAF) can still fund you. For non‑US entities not recognized as US public charities, funders typically use either equivalency determination (ED) or expenditure responsibility (ER). ED lowers reporting burden but requires documentation; ER is often faster but comes with tighter grant agreement and reporting. ([cof.org](https://cof.org/content/equivalency-determination-or-expenditure-responsibility))

Practical next steps
- If Open Phil is interested and you’re pre‑incorporation, propose receiving the grant through a fiscal sponsor; many OP‑funded early projects do this. Provide a draft budget, milestones, and a suggested sponsor. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If you prefer to receive funds directly as an individual, ask your OP contact whether they’d route support via SVCF (their DAF) or their 501(c)(3) and what documentation they’ll need; OP’s public materials confirm these routes. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/how-to-apply-for-funding/?utm_source=openai))
- If you’ll set up your own entity soon, consider pursuing NGOsource ED to make future US grants easier; otherwise expect ER-style grant terms initially. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/understanding-equivalency-determination-for-grantees?utm_source=openai))

If you’d like, I can:
- Suggest fiscal sponsors that fit EA-aligned projects and handle cross‑border disbursements.
- Draft a short “pre‑incorporation/disbursement” memo you can send to OP outlining your preferred route (individual vs fiscal sponsor vs entity-in-formation).",link to OP docs irrelevant. otherwise good answer,3.0

- Support: [finance@company.com or Slack channel]

City tier caps appendix (example—customize)
- Tier 1 (e.g., NYC, London, SF): Hotel up to [X], Meals per day up to [Y]
- Tier 2 (major cities): Hotel up to [X-1], Meals [Y-1]
- Tier 3 (other): Hotel up to [X-2], Meals [Y-2]

Quick reference (post this in your wiki)
- Submit within 10 business days, receipts ≥ [threshold]
- Economy under 6h; premium economy 6h+; business only by pre-approval
- Hotel within city cap; no mini-bar/spa
- Use public transit where practical; compact rentals
- Meals: stay within caps; no alcohol for internal-only meals
- Gifts/entertainment need business purpose and attendee list
- Pre-approve: international travel, trips > [X], conferences > [X], client entertainment > [X]
- When unsure, ask Finance before spending

To tailor this for you, please tell me:
1) Your company name, countries of operation, and currency
2) Do you prefer per diems or “actuals” with caps for meals?
3) Typical travel patterns (domestic, international, flight length) and any cabin rules you want
4) Receipt threshold and expected submission/approval timelines
5) City caps or a “reasonable + manager approval” approach?
6) Do you issue corporate cards? If yes, to",too opinionated and long,2.0,"Happy to help. To point you to the right version and keep it compliant, a couple quick questions:
1) Where will this policy apply primarily (US, UK/EU, Colombia, other)?
2) How big is your team today, and do you expect employees, contractors, or both?
3) Are you operating under a fiscal sponsor right now? If yes, do they have any required expense protocols?

In the meantime, here’s a lean expense policy you can use as a starting point for a small org/fiscally sponsored project. I can turn this into a 2–3 page editable doc once you confirm the details above.

Purpose and scope
- Reimburse reasonable, necessary business expenses incurred while conducting organizational work.
- Applies to employees, contractors (if allowed by contract), and volunteers with pre-approval.

Approval and limits
- Pre-approval required for any expense over $250 (set your threshold).
- Standard approver: Project Lead approves staff; Board Chair (or sponsor) approves Project Lead’s expenses.
- No self-approval.

Eligible expenses
- Travel: economy airfare, standard lodging, local transport, baggage.
- Meals while traveling on business; follow per diem or actuals (choose one).
- Office/IT: modest equipment, software subscriptions tied to work.
- Program costs directly tied to funded activities.

Non-reimbursable examples
- Alcohol outside business meals, luxury upgrades, personal travel legs, family expenses, traffic fines, political contributions.

Documentation and timing
- Submit expense report within 30 days of expense or trip end.
- Itemized receipts required; keep logs for mileage and business purpose.
- For US use: structure reimbursements as an IRS “accountable plan” (business connection, timely substantiation, and return of any excess). Require receipts for lodging and for other expenses of $75 or more, except certain transport where receipts aren’t available. These rules keep reimbursements non-taxable to staff. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463?utm_source=openai))

Payment methods
- Prefer org/sponsor card when available; otherwise employee pays and requests reimbursement.
- Advances allowed for approved trips; reconcile within 15 days of return; return any unused advance. Under an accountable plan, unreturned excess becomes taxable. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-compensation-of-officers?utm_source=openai))

Per diem and mileage (if you choose per diem)
- Use federal per diem rates and IRS standard mileage; no receipts required for meals/lodging covered by per diem, but you must track dates, location, and business purpose. ([irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463?utm_source=openai))

Fraud and exceptions
- False claims may lead to discipline and repayment.
- Exceptions require written approval from the approver noted above.

Next steps
- Tell me your region, team size, and whether you’re fiscally sponsored. I’ll tailor this (limits, approvers, per diem vs actuals, mileage, and any sponsor-required language) and deliver a clean 2–3 page policy you can adopt. If you’d like, I can also generate a simple one-page expense report template to match.",short and to the point. though it didn't link to the Portal's docs template,4.0,"Great—here’s a concise, ready‑to‑use Expense (Travel & Entertainment) Policy you can drop into your handbook. I tailored it for an EA‑aligned, grant‑funded org that’s early‑stage, remote, Colombia‑based, and likely fiscally sponsored in the US. You can keep it lean now and expand later.

[ORGANIZATION NAME] Expense Policy
Effective date: [YYYY‑MM‑DD]
Owner: Operations • Review cycle: Annual

1) Purpose and scope
- Purpose: Enable necessary spending to advance our mission while stewarding donor funds responsibly.
- Scope: Applies to all staff, contractors, and volunteers incurring expenses on behalf of [Org]. If you are operating under a fiscal sponsor, the sponsor’s policies and approvals take precedence; where conflicts exist, the stricter policy applies. Note: in common “Model A” sponsorships, staff are employed by and subject to the sponsor’s rules. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

2) Principles
- Mission‑aligned and necessary: Spend only what’s needed to meet clear org goals.
- Frugal by default: Choose economy options that are safe and practical.
- Compliant: Follow sponsor terms, grant restrictions, local laws, and this policy.
- Transparent: Document the business purpose and retain itemized receipts.

3) Roles and approvals
- Employee/contractor: Obtain pre‑approval where required; submit accurate, timely reports with receipts.
- Manager: Verify necessity, budget availability, and compliance before approving.
- Operations/Finance: Maintain systems, reimburse on time, audit samples, and update policy.
- Pre‑approvals required: Any trip; any single expense over [USD/EUR/COP threshold]; new software > [USD 250]/yr; equipment > [USD 400]; client entertainment; exceptions to this policy.

4) Reimbursable vs non‑reimbursable
- Reimbursable (examples)
  - Travel for approved meetings, events, site visits.
  - Lodging at reasonably priced hotels or short‑term rentals (mid‑market tier).
  - Local transport (economy flights; rail/bus; standard ride‑hailing; public transit).
  - Meals while traveling or during approved business meetings.
  - Visas, required vaccinations, travel insurance for work travel.
  - Modest home‑office basics with pre‑approval (mouse, keyboard, webcam, headset, laptop stand). Laptops/monitors require ops approval and tracking.
  - Work software tied to roles; renewals routed via ops.
  - Reasonable data/roaming when needed for work.
- Non‑reimbursable (examples)
  - First/business class travel (unless medically required and pre‑approved).
  - Room upgrades, minibar, in‑room entertainment, personal travel add‑ons.
  - Alcohol without prior approval or beyond modest quantities at a bona fide business meal.
  - Family travel costs, childcare, pet care, personal clothing, traffic fines.
  - Charitable donations, political contributions, or gifts exceeding [USD 50] per recipient without ops approval.
  - Loss/theft of personal items, travel loyalty buy‑ups, airline clubs (unless pre‑approved for frequent travel).

5) Travel standards
- Air: Economy class; choose the lowest logical fare considering safety and total journey time. Trips > 6 hours may use premium economy with approval.
- Rail/Bus: Use standard class where safe/practical.
- Lodging: Target [USD 100–180] per night in high‑cost US cities, adjust to local market elsewhere; prioritize safety and proximity to work site.
- Ground: Use public transit where safe; otherwise standard ride‑hailing or taxis. Car rentals compact class; add insurance where required by local law.
- Carbon: Prefer trains/direct flights where feasible; batch meetings to reduce trips.

6) Meals and per diem
- Choose one method per trip:
  - Per diem: Use the lower of (a) sponsor/grant‑mandated per diem, or (b) internal cap of [USD XX domestic / USD YY international] excluding alcohol. No receipts required for per diem, but trip approval and business purpose are required.
  - Actuals: Itemized receipts required; reasonable tips included. No per diem stacking.

7) International and currency
- Currency: Reimburse in [home currency] at the card/network rate shown on the statement; cash expenses converted using the rate on the expense date.
- Local compliance: Follow country‑specific documentation rules (e.g., legal invoices in Colombia when applicable). When under a US fiscal sponsor, you may need extra detail for US accounting—follow sponsor instructions. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))

8) Home‑office and equipment
- Standard kit: Org‑issued laptop plus up to [USD 300] of peripherals per 24 months with pre‑approval.
- Asset tracking: All org‑funded equipment must be logged; return upon offboarding.
- Furniture: Case‑by‑case; prioritize portable, low‑cost items.

9) Software and subscriptions
- Use org accounts and negotiated nonprofit discounts when available; avoid personal purchases. Ops manages provisioning and renewals. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))

10) Client, partner, and event expenses
- Modest hospitality is allowed when it advances mission objectives. Alcohol must be",too opinionated,2.0
Give me a budget template for our first year of operations,"Great—here’s a simple, adaptable first‑year budget template you can drop into Excel/Google Sheets. It’s set up for monthly planning with an annual roll‑up and separate sections for startup costs, revenue, COGS, operating expenses, payroll, and cash flow.

How to structure your workbook
- Sheet 0: Assumptions
- Sheet 1: Revenue
- Sheet 2: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or Direct Costs
- Sheet 3: Payroll
- Sheet 4: Operating Expenses (Opex)
- Sheet 5: Capital Expenditures (CapEx)
- Sheet 6: Cash Flow
- Sheet 7: KPIs and Summary

Common columns (Sheets 1–6)
- Columns A–B: Category, Subcategory/Notes
- Columns C–N: Month 1 to Month 12
- Column O: Annual Total (=SUM of months)

Sheet 0: Assumptions (drive everything with inputs)
- Launch month: enter Month 1 date
- Pricing: Unit Price, Average Order Value, ARPU, etc.
- Volume: Leads per month, Conversion rate, Orders per month, Units sold, Churn rate
- Payment terms: Days sales outstanding (DSO), Days payables outstanding (DPO)
- Headcount plan: Hire month, base salary, benefits % or flat amount
- Payroll taxes/benefits load: e.g., 15% of gross
- Vendor contracts: fixed fees, start month, escalation %
- COGS rates: % of revenue or cost per unit
- CapEx: item, cost, month, depreciation period (months)
- Tax rate and contingency % (e.g., 10%)

Sheet 1: Revenue
- Rows (example): Units Sold, Average Price, Gross Revenue, Discounts, Net Revenue, Deferred/Prepaid Adjustments (if needed).
- Example formulas:
  - Gross Revenue m = Units Sold m * Average Price
  - Discounts m = Gross Revenue m * Discount %
  - Net Revenue m = Gross Revenue m − Discounts m
- If subscription/SaaS, add:
  - New Customers m, Churned Customers m = Prior MRR Customers * Churn %
  - Ending Customers m = Prior + New − Churned
  - MRR m = Ending Customers m * ARPU
  - Net Revenue m = MRR m plus any one‑time fees

Sheet 2: COGS / Direct Costs
- Rows: Materials, Freight, Payment Processing, Direct Labor (if applicable), Hosting (for software), Packaging, Warranty/Returns.
- Example formulas:
  - Materials m = Units Sold m * Material Cost per Unit (from Assumptions)
  - Payment Processing m = Net Revenue m * Processing %
  - Gross Margin m = Net Revenue m − Total COGS m
  - Gross Margin % m = Gross Margin m / Net Revenue m

Sheet 3: Payroll
- Columns: Role, Start Month, Base Salary, Benefits %, Monthly Cost across months.
- Example formulas:
  - Monthly Salary m for a role = IF(m >= Start Month, Base Salary/12, 0)
  - Benefits m = Monthly Salary m * Benefits %
  - Payroll Taxes m = Monthly Salary m * Payroll Tax %
  - Total Payroll m = SUM of all roles’ (Salary + Benefits + Taxes)
- Optional: Contractor rows with hourly rate * hours.

Sheet 4: Operating Expenses (Opex)
- Categories: Rent, Utilities, Insurance, Software, Marketing (ads, content, events), Professional Services (legal, accounting), Travel, Office, Training, Misc, Contingency.
- Example formulas:
  - Rent m: flat or with escalation (e.g., prior month * 1.03 if 3% annual escalator spread monthly)
  - Marketing: driver‑based (e.g., CAC model) or fixed budget by channel
  - Contingency m = (Payroll m + Opex excluding contingency m) * Contingency %

Sheet 5: Capital Expenditures (CapEx)
- Rows: Laptops, Furniture, Machinery, Leasehold Improvements, Initial tooling, One‑time software setup.
- Columns: Cost, Purchase Month, Depreciation Months, Monthly Depreciation.
- Example formulas:
  - Depreciation m (straight line) = IF(m >= Purchase Month, Cost/Depreciation Months, 0)
- Note: CapEx is a cash outflow in purchase month; depreciation is a non‑cash expense used for EBITDA/NI if you model that.

Sheet 6: Cash Flow
- Start with Beginning Cash balance.
- Inflows:
  - Cash Collections from Revenue m = Net Revenue of prior months adjusted by DSO (e.g., 50% current month, 50% next month, or a DSO‑based lag)
  - Other income (grants, loans, equity draws)
- Outflows:
  - COGS cash (respect DPO if paying suppliers later)
  - Payroll cash (usually current month)
  - Opex cash (may include prepaids; spread per contract)
  - CapEx cash (purchase month)
  - Loan repayments/interest
- Example structure:
  - Beginning Cash m
  - Net Cash from Operations m = Cash Inflows m − Cash Outflows m (excluding financing)
  - Net Cash from Financing m = New Debt/Equity − Repayments/Dividends
  - Ending Cash m = Beginning Cash m + Net Cash from Operations m + Net Cash from Investing m + Net Cash from Financing m
- Runway:
  - Average Monthly Burn = AVERAGE of negative monthly net cash over last 3–6 months
  - Runway (months) = Ending Cash / ABS(Average Monthly Burn)

Sheet 7: KPIs and Summary
- Revenue: Monthly Net Revenue, Annual Net Revenue
- Gross Margin %: Annual and monthly
- EBITDA (optional): Net Revenue − COGS − Opex − Payroll + Depreciation addback if desired
- CAC, LTV, LTV/CAC, Payback Period (if doing paid acquisition)
- Cash: Minimum cash, months with negative ending cash (flag)
- Headcount by month

Common formulas to paste (adapt as needed)
- Annual total in O column: =SUM(C2:N2)
- Gross Margin % (row): =IF(NetRevenue>0, GrossMargin/NetRevenue, 0)
- Collections with 70/30 split: Collections m = 0.7*NetRevenue m + 0.3*NetRevenue (m−1)
- DSO approximation (31‑day month): Collections m = NetRevenue (m−DSO/31), use an offset or simple staged lags
- CAC (if using paid ads): CAC = Ad Spend / New Customers
- LTV (subscription): LTV = ARPU * Gross Margin % / Churn Rate
- Payback (months): CAC / (ARPU * Gross Margin %)

Tips
- Separate “expense by nature” (rent, salaries) from “expense by function” (R&D, S&M, G&A) unless you need both.
- Use data validation for categories and a single Chart of Accounts list to keep naming consistent.
- Color‑code input cells and lock formulas.
- Add a scenario toggle (Base/Low/High) using a drop‑down that switches key Assumptions via CH",too generic,1.0,"Great—here’s a simple, first‑year operating budget template you can drop into Google Sheets/Excel. I tailored the categories to your stage (2 FTE founders, grant-funded, Colombia-based, likely under a fiscal sponsor, expecting Open Philanthropy funds).

How to structure the sheet
- Tabs: Summary (annual), Monthly Detail, Assumptions (exchange rates, salary bands, sponsor fee %, benefits %, inflation), Notes/Restrictions.
- Columns (Monthly Detail): Category, Subcategory, Funding Source/Restriction (Unrestricted, Restricted: OP grant), Jan–Dec, Total.
- Summary rolls up Monthly Detail by category and by restriction.

Income (rows)
- Grants: Open Philanthropy (Restricted), Other grants (specify), Individual donations (Unrestricted), Earned revenue (if any).
- Interest/other income.
- Less: Fiscal sponsor fee (if the sponsor takes their % off the top; otherwise place under Expenses > Admin). Many sponsors charge 5–15%. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Expenses (rows)
Program (delivery)
- Personnel: Founder A comp, Founder B comp, Benefits/taxes (see Assumptions), Advisors/contractors, Stipends.
- Travel: Program travel, lodging, per diem.
- Program software/data: AI tools, model/API credits, evaluation tools.

Operations/Administration
- Fiscal sponsor fee (if not netted above; use your sponsor’s %), Bookkeeping/accounting, Legal and compliance, Banking/FX fees and transfer costs, Insurance (general liability/D&O, if applicable), Office/coworking, Equipment.
- Software stack (net of nonprofit discounts): Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, Asana/ClickUp, Airtable/CRM, Password manager, Security tools, Cloud storage, E-signature. Plan for discounts via nonprofit programs to keep costs realistic. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))
- Communications: Website/domain, design, email marketing.
- Fundraising/BD: Travel, sponsorships, events.
- Contingency (5–10% of total expenses).
- Indirect/Overhead allocation (if your funder expects it shown separately).

International/FX notes for your context
- Add an “FX Rate (USD/COP)” assumption and a “FX impact” line so variances are visible.
- Separate “US-dollar denominated” vs “Local-currency” costs (two helper columns) to track exposure.
- Include “Payment processing/transfer fees” (e.g., Wise, bank wires) in Admin > Banking/FX.

Assumptions to set on day 1
- Fiscal sponsor fee % and whether it’s applied to all receipts or only certain sources. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- FX rate baseline and reforecast cadence (e.g., quarterly).
- Benefits load (12–25% typical if you add health/retirement; set to your reality).
- Software discount eligibility and timing (some require proof of nonprofit status; if you’re pre‑status, budget full price for the first months). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))

Quick setup tips for your situation
- Create two summary views: by Funding Restriction (to report back to OP) and by Category (to manage burn).
- Tag each expense with “Grant code” so you can export a clean grant report later.","good, csv worked better. gave me a few good tips on what to present to OP",4.0,"Great—here’s a lightweight, first‑year budget template tailored to your situation (2 FTE founders, fiscally sponsored, primarily grant-funded, Colombia-based with US registration plans).

Can you help with board governance and setting up a board?,"Absolutely. I can help you design the right board structure, draft the core docs, and set up governance that actually works. To tailor this, a few quick questions:
- Jurisdiction and entity type (e.g., Delaware C‑Corp, UK Ltd, LLC)?
- Stage and scale (pre‑seed, Series A, bootstrapped; revenue/headcount)?
- Current/future investors and their rights (board seats, observers)?
- Top priorities/risks for the next 12–18 months (e.g., fundraising, go‑to‑market, compliance)?
- Desired level of founder control vs. independent oversight?
- Any regulatory context (e.g., public sector contracts, financial services, healthcare)?

Below is a concise framework you can use right away.

1) Choose the board type and size
- Fiduciary board vs. advisory board: fiduciary has legal duties and formal decision rights; advisory is flexible but non‑binding. Many startups use both.
- Size: start with 3 or 5 voting directors. Typical early mix: 1–2 founders, 1 investor, 1–2 independent directors.
- Roles: Chair (or Lead Independent Director), CEO, Committee Chairs (as needed).

2) Composition and selection
- Skills matrix: map needed competencies (domain, GTM, finance, product/tech, security, people/comp, legal/regulatory).
- Independence: ensure at least one truly independent director; avoid stacked boards.
- Diversity: target diversity in background and thought to improve decision quality.
- Observers: allow investor/founder observers via written observer rights, with clear confidentiality and participation limits.

3) Decision rights and guardrails
- Board charter: purpose, duties, meeting cadence, information rights, confidentiality, evaluation.
- Reserved matters: list items requiring board approval (budget, debt, M&A, option pool changes, exec hires/fires, related‑party deals, issuance of new shares, large contracts).
- Voting thresholds: define simple majority vs. supermajority items; add deadlock mechanisms (e.g., chair tie‑break, mediation).
- Delegation: RACI for key decisions; define management authorities and spending limits.

4) Core legal and protection package
- Bylaws/Operating Agreement updates to reflect board structure.
- Initial board resolutions: appoint directors/officers; approve equity plan; banking; fiscal year; policies.
- Director on‑boarding: IP and confidentiality agreements; indemnification agreements; access to D&O insurance.
- Policies: code of conduct, conflicts of interest, related‑party transactions, whistleblower, info security, disclosure controls (scaled to stage).

5) Committees and oversight (right‑size to stage)
- Early stage: combine Audit/Finance & Risk; Compensation & Talent; Nominating/Governance. Even one committee can meet ad hoc.
- What they cover:
  - Audit/Finance & Risk: budgets, cash runway, controls, cybersecurity/risk register.
  - Compensation & Talent: exec comp, equity grants, succession planning.
  - Nominating/Governance: director recruitment, evaluations, board education.

6) Cadence, materials, and mechanics
- Cadence: monthly or bi‑monthly at pre‑Series A; quarterly at later stages; annual strategy offsite.
- Pack: 3–5 KPIs, financials and runway, hiring and pipeline, product/roadmap, risks and mitigations, decisions requested.
- Executive sessions: non‑management directors meet without the CEO each meeting; Chair summarizes feedback.
- Minutes: action‑oriented, record decisions and rationales; store securely (board portal or encrypted drive).

7) Compensation for directors
- Early cash‑light: equity only for independents (e.g., 0.25–1.0% vesting over 2–3 years), plus expense reimbursement.
- Later stage: modest cash retainers plus equity refreshers; committee chair premiums.

8) Board effectiveness and culture
- Onboarding: 30–60‑day plan including data room, product demo, customer calls.
- Annual board evaluation and director peer feedback; refresh matrix annually.
- Norms: candid debate, time‑boxed discussions, pre‑reads 72 hours in advance, no surprises rule.

9) Information rights and data room
- Standardize monthly reporting; provide equal access to all directors.
- Maintain a clean data room: charter/bylaws, cap table, policies, board packs, minutes, resolutions, KPIs.

Practical 90‑day setup plan
- Weeks 1–2: Define board purpose/size; draft skills matrix; identify candidates; decide reserved matters and voting thresholds.
- Weeks 3–4: Update bylaws/operating agreement; prepare charter, conflict policy, indemnification agreements; line up D&O insurance.
- Weeks 5–6: Recruit and confirm independents; finalize observer rights; approve initial board resolutions.
- Weeks 7–8: Stand up board portal; set annual calendar; establish KPIs and board pack template.
- Weeks 9–12: First meeting with decisions log, risk register, and committee charters; schedule executive sessions and evaluation cadence.

What I can deliver next
- A tailored board charter, initial resolutions, and a reserved‑matters schedule.
- A skills matrix template and candidate profile.
- Board pack template (agenda, KPI dashboard, minutes), plus conflict and related‑party policies.
- Sample observer rights letter and director offer letter with equity terms.

If you share your jurisdiction, stage, and any investor constraints, I’ll draft the first set of documents to match your situation.",,,"Absolutely. I can help you design “good enough for now” board governance and get your first board set up.

A couple quick questions so I can tailor this:
- Will you form your own US nonprofit soon or operate under a fiscal sponsor for year 1?
- If forming in the US, which state are you leaning toward?
- How many people will be actively involved over the next 6–12 months?

Starter guidance for your stage (early, 2 founders, likely fiscally sponsored; Colombia-based planning US registration)
- If fiscally sponsored: the sponsor’s board is the legal governing body. Many projects create a small advisory board (3–5 people) for guidance, credibility, and intros; no fiduciary duties, but clear scopes and meeting cadence (quarterly) help a lot. This is common in Model A/C sponsorships. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If forming a US nonprofit: most states allow a lean initial board. A practical starting size is 3–5 directors, with an independent majority and clear officer roles (chair, secretary, treasurer). Hold an organizational meeting to adopt bylaws, a conflict-of-interest policy, set meeting cadence, authorize a bank account, and minute everything. Minimums and annual-meeting rules vary by state; for example, New York requires at least three directors and at least one board meeting per year. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-and-charity-compliance-checklist?utm_source=openai))

What “good enough” looks like in months 0–3
- Board composition: mix 1–2 mission/EA domain experts, 1 finance/legal/ops generalist, 1 stakeholder connector; avoid a board made only of close friends or funders with active conflicts.
- Core documents to adopt: bylaws, conflict of interest policy, board calendar, simple skills matrix, consent of directors for initial actions (banking, filings).
- Cadence and mechanics: quarterly meetings; 60–90 minutes; consent agendas; draft milestones/risks dashboard; capture actions in minutes.
- Clarity on founder roles: if a founder is paid staff later, keep them off the voting board or recuse on compensation; document this in minutes.

Resource Portal items to use
- State setup/compliance examples (helps you see what states ask of boards). Example: New York setup + compliance checklist (board minimums, meetings, filings). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))
- Fiscal Sponsorship models overview (to decide sponsor vs. own entity and whether you need an advisory board now). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

Next steps I can do for you
- Draft: a 2–3 page bylaws starter outline, conflict-of-interest policy, first-board-meeting agenda/minutes template, and a one-page advisory board charter.
- Help you build a short board skills matrix and target list.

Quick note: board law is state-specific; before filing, run final bylaws past a nonprofit attorney/CPA in your chosen state. Would you like me to start with the templates, and which state are you considering?",,,"Absolutely—happy to help. Given your stage (idea validation, likely fiscal sponsorship, US registration planned), here’s a pragmatic path plus a few clarifying questions so I can tailor templates.

Key decision first: Governing board vs. advisory board
- If you operate under a Model A “comprehensive” fiscal sponsorship: the sponsor’s board is the legal governing body. You typically set up an advisory board (non‑fiduciary) for advice, credibility, and introductions; no formal governance powers needed. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If you use Model C (pre‑approved grant) or spin up your own US entity: you’ll need your own governing board and core governance documents (articles, bylaws, COI policy, minutes). New York example: at least 3 directors and one meeting annually; bylaws are required for registrations. Other states vary, but 3 independent directors is a strong US nonprofit best‑practice starting point. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-and-charity-compliance-checklist?utm_source=openai))

Board composition (early-stage best practice)
- Size: start with 3–5 directors; aim for a majority independent (not staff, not close family, not paid contractors). Keep founders in the minority if feasible; if a founder must sit on the board, separate the board chair and executive roles as soon as practical.
- Profiles to target: 1) mission/EA community credibility, 2) finance/compliance, 3) fundraising/relationships; optionally 4) program domain expert; 5) legal/risk.
- Conflicts: adopt a simple, enforced conflict‑of‑interest (COI) policy with disclosure at appointment and annually; document recusals in minutes. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-charity-conflict-of-interest?utm_source=openai))

Board duties and annual cadence
- Core duties: mission/strategy approval, executive oversight (hire/evaluate lead), budget and financial oversight, risk and safeguarding, key policies, and compliance sign‑offs.
- Cadence: quarterly meetings (60–90 min) with a consent agenda; one annual meeting covering budget approval, risk/policy review, ED evaluation, and board self‑assessment. New York requires at least one meeting; keep minutes. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-and-charity-compliance-checklist?utm_source=openai))

Minimal document set to adopt on day one
- Bylaws (keep lean; reserve policy detail for separate docs).
- COI policy for board/staff/contractors; disclosure form. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-charity-conflict-of-interest?utm_source=openai))
- Board charter + annual calendar (what decisions happen when).
- Minutes template; unanimous written consent template for between‑meeting approvals.
- If fiscally sponsored: advisory board charter clarifying non‑fiduciary status. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))

If you’ll register in the US shortly
- Pick state first (often DE, DC, NY, or CA depending on donors/ops). State rules differ, but filing typically requires articles, initial directors, and bylaws; then pursue IRS exemption and charity registrations. NY example checklists show what regulators expect (directors’ info, bylaws, EIN, etc.). ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/new-york-nonprofit-charity-and-legal-entity-setup?utm_source=openai))

90‑day setup plan (lightweight)
- Weeks 0–2: Decide sponsorship model and state; draft board profile matrix; identify 5–8 candidates; run conflict screens; line up 3–5. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- Weeks 2–4: Draft bylaws and COI policy; prepare charter, calendar, and minute/consent templates; circulate to candidates for review. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-charity-conflict-of-interest?utm_source=openai))
- Weeks 4–8: Convene first board meeting to approve bylaws, adopt policies, appoint officers, approve budget, authorize bank and filings. Document minutes.
- Weeks 8–12: Stand up basic governance infrastructure: board portal/folder, annual disclosures, meeting schedule, and a simple grants/CRM tracker for board reporting. (You can repurpose AE’s Airtable templates for contact/board tracking.) ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/airtable-crm-template?utm_source=openai))

Common risk flags to avoid
- Shadow governance by funders or advisors without proper appointment. Keep advisory and board roles distinct; document who has decision rights. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))
- Conflicted transactions (e.g., paying a director or founder‑controlled vendor) without recusal, comparability data, and board approval.
- Overloading bylaws with operational detail—use policies so you can iterate quickly.

Starter resources (I can adapt these for you)
- Fiscal sponsorship models and implications for control/board needs. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- COI policy guidance and example disclosures (UK‑focused but principles transfer; I’ll localize to US).",,
How much weekly time on average does it require handling the overhead of being a registered nonprofit? (assuming I'm fiscally sponsored). What does that depend on?,"Short answer
- If you’re fiscally sponsored, most small-to-mid projects spend about 2–6 hours per week on “nonprofit overhead” in a steady state.
- Expect spikes to 8–20 hours in deadline weeks (grant proposals/reports, audits, big events, new hires).
- Very lean micro-projects with one funding source can get down to ~1–2 hours; complex, grant-heavy projects can average 6–10.

What that time usually covers
- Sponsor coordination: submitting expenses and reimbursements, approving payments, updating budgets, monthly check-ins.
- Finance/admin: receipts, vendor setup, coding expenses to grants, reviewing monthly statements, light bookkeeping if not covered by sponsor.
- Compliance and policies: timesheets, lobbying/electioneering checks, volunteer/participant waivers, insurance certificates.
- Fundraising admin: donor acknowledgments (if not automated by sponsor), grant calendars, data entry, grant reporting inputs.
- Governance and strategy: advisory meetings, planning, documenting decisions (boards are usually at the sponsor level, but you still do project-level oversight).
- HR/ops: posting roles, onboarding contractors or staff, timesheet approvals, payroll changes (often routed through sponsor).

What the workload depends on
1) Sponsor model and services
- “Model A” (project housed inside sponsor) tends to be lowest lift; sponsor holds the bank account, signs contracts, processes payroll, handles 990, insurance.
- “Model C” (pre-approved grant relationship) pushes more finance/compliance onto you; time goes up.
- What’s included vs add-on: bookkeeping detail, grant reporting support, donor receipting, payroll/benefits, insurance COIs, contract review, audit support.

2) Funding mix and restrictions
- Number of active grants and their reporting cadence.
- Restricted vs unrestricted funds; multi-funder cost allocations add time.
- Government grants can multiply admin time 2–3x vs private philanthropy.

3) People and payroll
- Volunteers only: lighter.
- Contractors: moderate (agreements, W‑9s, invoices).
- Employees: heavier (recruiting, onboarding, timesheets, performance, payroll changes, benefits questions).

4) Program complexity
- Events, earned revenue, or fee-for-service add contracts, insurance, and sales tax questions.
- Work in multiple states/countries adds registrations and compliance checks (often via sponsor, but you supply information).

5) Funder expectations and cadence
- Heavy proposal/reporting seasons create time spikes.
- Data/evaluation requirements increase ongoing admin.

6) Your internal systems
- Good documentation, templates, and automation can cut time in half; ad hoc workflows inflate it.

Sample scenarios (weekly averages across the year)
- Micro project, 1 donor, Model A sponsor, contractors only: 1–2 hrs
- Small project, 3–5 grants, quarterly reporting, 1 employee: 3–6 hrs
- Growing project, 8–12 grants incl. 1 government grant, 3–6 employees: 6–10 hrs
- Event-heavy season or new government award month: 10–20 hrs (temporarily)

How to keep it on the low end
- Choose a sponsor that includes: donor receipting, AP/AR, payroll/benefits, grant reporting support, COIs, contract review, and a clear SLA with turnaround times.
- Consolidate funding where possible; prefer multi‑year, unrestricted gifts.
- Keep a single source of truth: budget vs actuals by grant, document folder structure, and a deadline calendar.
- Batch admin: one weekly “ops block” to submit expenses, approve timesheets, and update the grant tracker.
- Use tools your sponsor supports: expense app with receipt capture, e‑signature, shared dashboards.
- Standardize templates: SOWs, contractor agreements, budget narratives, logic models, report shells.
- Pre-clear allowable activities (lobbying, international payments, participant incentives) to avoid back‑and‑forth.

Questions to ask a potential sponsor
- What’s included in base fee vs add-on rates? Typical processing times?
- Who codes expenses to grants—us or you? Who prepares financials for reports?
- Do you issue donor acknowledgments and manage donor records/CRM?
- Can you handle government grants and time/effort reporting?
- What insurance do you carry, and how fast can we get COIs?
- Do you support multi-state operations and international payments?
- What are your policies on lobbying, subawards, and fiscal controls?
- What does onboarding look like, and what’s the average staff time projects spend monthly?

If you share your project size, funding sources, and sponsor model, I can estimate a more specific weekly range and outline a right-sized ops routine.",concrete without feeling made-up,4.0,"Short answer: for a small, fiscally sponsored project (≈2 FTE, a few grants), plan on 3–6 hours per week on average for “overhead.” In quiet months you might spend 1–2 hours; during busy periods (new grant, hiring, reporting, audits) it can spike to 8–12 hours for a few weeks.

What that time usually covers
- Finance/admin: coding expenses, approving invoices, reviewing monthly statements, light budgeting (1–2 hrs/wk).
- Grant management: tracking deliverables, light reporting/prep, funder comms (0.5–2 hrs/wk; more near deadlines).
- Compliance/process: updating simple policies, filing light paperwork the sponsor needs, documenting decisions (0.25–1 hr/wk).
- People ops: contractor onboarding, timesheets/approvals, performance check-ins (0–2 hrs/wk, depends on team size).
- Tooling and documentation: keeping your tracker/CRM/Drive tidy, backups, access management (0.25–1 hr/wk).

What drives the variance
- Sponsor model and service level: “comprehensive” sponsors (A-model, back-office included) cut your time vs. lighter C-models where you do more yourself.
- Number and type of funders: more grants = more reporting cycles; govt/complex funders add requirements.
- Team footprint: employees vs. contractors; international payments; background checks; equipment.
- Geography and compliance scope: where you and your beneficiaries are (US/EU/UK data/privacy rules; local registrations).
- Spending complexity: subgrants, restricted funds, FX, and procurement thresholds add review time.
- Tool maturity: good templates/automations (expense capture, budget-to-actuals, grant tracker) reduce recurring effort.
- Documentation discipline: a simple operating cadence and checklists prevent last‑minute scrambles.

Practical target for your context (2 founders, fiscally sponsored, first Open Phil grant)
- Baseline cadence: 1-hour weekly ops block + 1-hour finance/review block; 30 minutes for funder/project updates.
- Monthly: 2–3 hours to reconcile budget-to-actuals with your sponsor, update grant tracker, and tidy documentation.
- Peaks: add 4–6 hours in any week with a grant report, new contractor onboarding, or a major purchase/contract.

Resource Portal starting points
- Fiscal sponsorship overview and responsibilities split (project vs. sponsor).
- Grant management basics: reporting trackers and budget-to-actual templates.
- Lightweight finance and controls templates for small teams.
If you’d like, I can pull the most relevant Portal templates and set up a 1-page “weekly ops checklist” and simple budget/grant tracker tailored to your situation.

Quick clarifiers to tailor this:
- Which country will your sponsor operate under for you (US-based?) and do you expect employees or just contractors in the first 6–12 months?
- How many funders besides Open Phil do you anticipate this year?","good answer, but doesn't feel as taylored to my needs as the first one",3.0,"Short answer
- If you’re fiscally sponsored and early‑stage (≤2 FTE, a few grants, light programs), expect 3–6 hours per week on average.
- If you’re growing (3–8 people, multiple funders, contractors in multiple countries), expect 6–12 hours per week.
- Peak periods (grant applications/renewals, audits, annual budgeting, hiring/spin‑ups) can spike to 10–20 hours in those weeks.

What drives the time up or down
1) Sponsor model and services
- Full‑service (“Model A”/comprehensive): Sponsor runs finance, payroll, insurance, compliance, donation processing, often vendor setup. Lowest project overhead.
- Grantor/“Model C” style: Sponsor regrants and offers light finance; you handle more ops (vendor onboarding, HR processes, procurement). Higher overhead.
- Service levels and SLAs: Faster AP/AR, templated contracts, and integrated tools save you hours.

2) Transaction volume and complexity
- Number of invoices/expense reports per month, purchasing (cards vs invoices), per‑diem vs receipts, multi‑currency, reimbursements to non‑US persons, OFAC/KYC checks, and whether you use restricted funds all add review/coordination time.

3) Headcount and geography
- More staff/contractors = onboarding, timesheets, expense coaching, performance admin, equipment, and compliance. Cross‑border payments and local law quirks (e.g., Colombia vs US) add coordination time.

4) Funding mix and reporting cadence
- Many small donors or platform donations are easy; multiple institutional grants with different budgets and report dates require more tracking, reclasses, and narrative/data pulls.

5) Controls and policies
- Sponsor’s required policies (conflicts, safeguarding, data protection, T&E) and any funder‑mandated procedures (e.g., procurement thresholds) create some recurring admin (training logs, approvals).

6) Tooling and process maturity
- Clear chart of accounts, standardized naming, templates, batch workflows, and a shared drive structure can cut your time by 30–50% versus ad‑hoc processes.

7) Program design
- Events, travel, subgrants, or stipends take more admin than research outputs or advisory work.

Typical weekly breakdown at your current stage (2 co‑founders, aiming for an Open Phil grant)
- Finance/AP and reimbursements: 1–2 hrs (collect receipts, code to budget lines, submit to sponsor, respond to clarifications).
- Grant management: 0.5–1.5 hrs (deadlines, deliverables, light M&E notes; spikes near reports).
- Contracting and vendor setup: 0–1 hr (weeks with a new contractor/vendor: 1–3 hrs to collect W‑8/W‑9, SOW, rates, and sponsor approvals).
- HR/admin: 0–0.5 hr (if just founders; add 1–2 hrs/wk when onboarding someone).
- Sponsor coordination: 0.5–1 hr (Slack/email check‑ins; answering coding/approval questions).
Average: roughly 3–6 hrs/wk; 8–12 hrs in busier months (e.g., grant start/renewal).

A quick self‑estimator
Start with 2 hours/wk, then add:
- +0.3 hr per staff/contractor
- +0.1 hr per invoice/expense you expect weekly (0.4 hr per complex cross‑border payment)
- +0.5 hr if you have restricted grants; +0.5 hr per additional institutional funder
- +0.5 hr if your sponsor is light‑service/Model C
- +0.5–1 hr if you operate in >1 currency or pay outside the sponsor’s country
- +0.5 hr if you run events or subgrants

How to keep it near the low end
- Choose a sponsor with: card programs for staff, integrated expense tools, fast AP, templated contracts, and clear SLAs.
- Batch admin: one “ops hour” each week for all approvals/submissions; one finance day per month for reconciliations and reporting.
- Standardize early: simple chart of accounts tied to your grant budget; filename conventions; a single intake form for all payments and contracts; SOW and invoice templates.
- Keep contractors recurring: master services agreements + statement‑of‑work addenda; ask for monthly invoicing on a set date with required fields.
- Minimize restricted pots: fewer, larger grants reduce reporting overhead.
- Document once: a living “how we pay and get paid” page for your team.

If useful, I can share ready‑to‑use templates (payment request form, receipt checklist, SOW/contractor pack, basic grant tracker) and a 30‑minute “month‑close” checklist tailored to a fiscally sponsored EA‑aligned project.",feels a bit made-up. still good comprehensive answer,3.0
What things do I need to get ready before hiring more people?,"Great question. Here’s a compact, practical checklist to get you truly “hire‑ready.” If you share your country/state and whether hires are employees or contractors, I can tailor this precisely.

Strategy and roles
- Headcount plan: why you’re hiring, success metrics for each role, expected start dates.
- Org design: reporting lines, manager bandwidth, career paths.
- Role design: job descriptions with outcomes for the first 30/60/90 days; required vs nice‑to‑have skills.

Money and compensation
- Budget: fully loaded cost per hire (salary, benefits, payroll tax, tools, equipment, space).
- Compensation bands: market ranges, internal equity, variable pay/commission plans, bonus criteria.
- Approval workflow: who signs off offers and exceptions.

Compliance and classification
- Worker type: employee vs contractor; exempt vs non‑exempt; full‑time vs part‑time.
- Jurisdiction setup: register for employer/payroll tax accounts where employees will work; confirm local posting/notice requirements.
- Core policies: anti‑harassment, equal employment opportunity, timekeeping/overtime, leave, expense reimbursements, privacy/data protection, code of conduct.
- Required docs (examples for the U.S.; varies by country): I‑9 and W‑4; state withholding forms; new‑hire reporting; posters/notices; workers’ comp; unemployment insurance.

Payroll, benefits, and systems
- Payroll provider chosen and tested; pay schedule set; direct deposit flow verified.
- Benefits: health/dental/vision, retirement plan, PTO/holidays, eligibility rules, open‑enrollment timeline.
- HRIS/ATS: a lightweight HR system to store records and an applicant tracking system for hiring.
- Security/access: SSO, MFA, least‑privilege role templates.

Hiring process and tools
- Sourcing plan: channels, budget, and employer brand assets (career page, JD templates, interview guides).
- Structured interviews: define competencies per role, question banks, scoring rubrics, panel training to reduce bias.
- Assessments/background checks: when and how used; ensure they’re job‑related and compliant.
- Candidate communication SLAs: response times, feedback standards.

Offers and pre‑boarding
- Offer templates: compensation, equity (if any), at‑will language (where applicable), contingencies.
- Agreements: IP assignment, confidentiality, arbitration/non‑compete only if lawful and necessary.
- Pre‑day‑one setup: hardware, accounts, tool licenses, desk/shipments, welcome email and schedule.

Onboarding and day‑one
- 30/60/90 plan per role; clear KPIs and definition of success.
- Manager playbook: first‑week agenda, regular 1:1s, feedback cadence, probation/trial period criteria.
- Culture and norms: decision‑making, communication channels, meeting etiquette, documentation standards.

Remote, hybrid, and international
- Where people will sit: entity/EOR/PEO decisions for other states/countries; payroll/tax nexus implications.
- Home‑office stipend policy, working‑hour expectations, equipment ownership/return.

Data, privacy, and security
- Data retention schedule for candidate/employee data; consent/notice language.
- Offboarding checklist in place (account revocation, equipment return, knowledge transfer).

Facilities and tooling
- Hardware standards per role; device management; inventory tracking.
- Core stack: email/SSO, chat, docs, project tracking, code/tools; permission templates by team.

Metrics and feedback
- Pipeline metrics: time‑to‑hire, source quality, offer‑accept rate, cost‑per‑hire.
- Onboarding metrics: time‑to‑productivity, new‑hire NPS, 90‑day retention.
- Review cycle: probation reviews, performance and compensation review calendar.

Common pitfalls to avoid
- Hiring without clear outcomes or a manager with time to onboard.
- Underestimating total cost or setting pay outside your bands.
- Misclassifying contractors/employees or missing jurisdiction registrations.
- Ad‑hoc interviews without rubrics, leading to bias and weak signals.
- Delayed equipment/account setup that kills week‑one momentum.

If you tell me:
- Your location(s)
- Number and types of roles
- Employees vs contractors
- Remote vs on‑site
- Desired start dates and budget range

…I’ll turn this into a tailored, step‑by‑step plan and provide doc templates you can use immediately.",generic,2.0,"Great question. To tailor this well: are you planning to hire employees or independent contractors, and in which countries will they be based? Also, are you going to be under a fiscal sponsor or forming your own entity in the near term?

What to get ready before you hire (small org, early stage)
1) Headcount plan and budget
- Roles, scope, and success metrics for the next 6–12 months
- Compensation bands (base, benefits/allowances, contractor rates) and a hiring budget tied to your grant runway
- Decide “employee vs. contractor” for each seat; this drives compliance, systems, and cost

2) Structure and hiring model
- If fiscally sponsored: confirm what the sponsor handles (payroll, contracts, benefits, approvals) and what you own; ask how hiring in other countries works under their model. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-models?utm_source=openai))
- If independent: decide per country whether you will
  - employ locally (register for payroll there),
  - use an employer-of-record (EOR) like Deel/Rippling Global, or
  - engage contractors (only when the role truly fits contractor status). For reference, contractor rules are country‑specific and strict in many places. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/employer-guidance-for-independent-contractors-germany?utm_source=openai))

3) Compliance and right-to-work
- Confirm work authorization/visa needs for any non‑citizen hires; build the lead time into your plan (UK example lead times and sponsor license obligations shown here). Similar requirements exist in the US/EU. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/uk-visa-guide?utm_source=openai))
- If forming a US org soon, line up EIN, state registrations, and payroll setup in your first hiring state

4) Core policies (keep them lightweight at first)
- Code of conduct and anti‑harassment
- Conflicts of interest (especially for founders/board) 
- Expenses and travel; time off/leave; whistleblowing
- Data protection and privacy practices if you’ll handle EU/UK data
You can start from the Portal’s policy/templates collection (examples below) and adapt. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/code-of-conduct-for-management-of-offices-co-working-spaces?utm_source=openai))

5) Documents and templates
- For employees: offer letter, IP/confidentiality/NDAs, and a simple handbook with the policies above. For contractors: a services agreement with clear scope, deliverables, IP assignment, and termination terms. NDA overview and templates are here. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/non-disclosure-agreement-nda?utm_source=openai))

6) Hiring process and tools
- Structured interview plan (scorecards tied to the role’s outcomes)
- One source of truth to track candidates (an Airtable base works fine early on) ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/airtable-crm-template?utm_source=openai))
- Nonprofit discounts for core software (email, project management, video, HR/ATS) to keep costs down ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/nonprofit-discounts?utm_source=openai))

7) Onboarding and operations
- Account provisioning checklist (email, docs, repos, data access)
- Security basics: MFA, least‑privilege access, shared password tool
- First‑90‑days onboarding plan with outcomes and regular check‑ins

8) Grant and sponsor alignment
- Map any funder restrictions to roles and time tracking
- If fiscally sponsored, confirm approval thresholds and reporting handoffs in writing. ([resourceportal.antientropy.org](https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/applying-exiting-fiscal-sponsorship?utm_source=openai))

- NDA overview and templates for offers/contractor",feels more intuitive,4.0,"Great question. Here’s a concise, practical pre-hiring readiness checklist tailored to your stage (early, EA-aligned, Colombia-based, planning US registration, likely under fiscal sponsorship).

Must-have before posting roles
- Headcount plan and budget
  - Role(s), start dates, salary/benefits estimates, and total annual cost incl. taxes, payroll fees, equipment, software, and a 10–15% contingency.
  - Approval rule: who can authorize new headcount and offers.

- Role design and classification
  - Written job descriptions with mission fit, outcomes for first 6–12 months, core competencies.
  - Worker type per location: employee vs contractor, and justification to avoid misclassification.
  - If cross-border: decide whether to use a US fiscal sponsor, a local employer (Colombia), or an Employer of Record (EOR).

- Legal ability to hire and pay
  - If using a US fiscal sponsor: signed agreement covering HR, payroll, benefits, insurance, IP ownership, and policies that will govern staff.
  - If employing directly in the US: EIN, state registrations (payroll/unemployment/withholding), workers’ comp, and payroll setup before start dates.
  - If employing in Colombia: verify local employment registrations, payroll, social security, and benefits compliance.
  - If contractors: compliant contracts per country, with IP assignment and clear deliverables.

- Baseline policies (kept lightweight but real)
  - Anti-harassment and code of conduct; conflict of interest; whistleblowing; safeguarding where relevant; equal opportunity statement; privacy/data protection; expenses and remote work.
  - Offer-letter and employment agreement templates; NDA + IP assignment.
  - Decision on background/reference checks and how you’ll handle adverse findings.

- Compensation philosophy and bands
  - Write down how you set pay (market data used, geographic adjustments, benefits included).
  - Salary bands for the roles you’re opening; published ranges in job posts.
  - Benefits stance (health/insurance via sponsor or stipend, PTO, equipment, learning budgets).

- Recruiting process, structured and fair
  - Standardized job post template with your mission and selection criteria.
  - Structured interview plan: stages, who evaluates what, scoring rubrics, and a pass/fail bar.
  - Candidate communications plan and decision SLAs; reference check template.
  - Simple ATS or spreadsheet + email templates to reduce time and bias.

- Security and data readiness
  - Accounts provisioning checklist (email, doc storage, calendar, Slack).
  - Device and access policy; MFA required; shared password manager; least-privilege defaults.
  - Folder structure and naming so new hires can find things on day 1.

- Onboarding plan
  - 30/60/90 goals tied to the JD; buddy/manager assigned; first-week schedule.
  - Equipment plan (who buys, what, and when), software licenses, and required trainings.

Nice-to-have (but soon after first hires)
- Lightweight leveling framework and titles to avoid ad‑hoc drift.
- Performance and feedback cadence; probation policy.
- Simple travel/expenses policy and reimbursement workflow.
- Risk register: top 5 people/ops risks and mitigations (misclassification, data, conduct).

Cross-border specifics to decide early
- US vs Colombia vs other locations: pick for each role.
- If US staff via fiscal sponsor: confirm who is legal employer, benefits offered, and who handles payroll taxes and insurance.
- If non-US hires and you don’t have entities: choose EOR vendor vs contractor model; compare total cost and compliance risk.
- Visas: if you might sponsor, flag timelines and costs now; otherwise set expectations in job posts.

Minimal order of operations (4–6 weeks)
1) Week 1: Approve headcount/budget; choose employment model per role (sponsor, entity, or EOR/contractor). Start payroll/EOR setup if needed.
2) Week 2: Finalize compensation bands and JD; adopt baseline policies; prepare offer/contract templates; set up ATS/spreadsheet.
3) Week 3: Build interview rubrics; train interviewers; decide on checks; prepare onboarding plan and equipment list.
4) Week 4: Post roles with ranges and criteria; open sourcing; begin structured screening.
5) Before offer: Validate employment setup in candidate’s location; run references; prepare written offer and start-date checklist.
6) Pre‑start: Provision accounts, order equipment, schedule first-week onboarding.

Where I can provide ready-to-use templates
- Contractor vs employee checklists and contracts (US/UK/EU options), NDA and IP assignment.
- US nonprofit/fiscal sponsorship hiring steps, plus annual compliance checklists.
- Baseline policies (anti-harassment, code of conduct, conflicts, whistleblowing, privacy, remote work, expenses).
- Onboarding checklists and 30/60/90 templates.
Say the word and I’ll pull the relevant templates and adapt them to your roles and countries.

Quick scoping questions so I tailor this for you
- Which countries do you expect to hire in for the next 1–2 roles?
- Will hires be employees (via sponsor/entity/EOR) or contractors?
- Target start month and budget range for each role (cash comp and any benefits)?

If you share those, I’ll turn this into a role-specific checklist and fill any gaps (e.g., exact registrations, sample compensation bands, and a day-1 onboarding plan).","good, comprehensive. harder to parse",3.0
